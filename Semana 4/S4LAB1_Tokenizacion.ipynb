         "\nApple's long and controversial ebook case has reached its final chapter — and it's not the happy ending the company wanted.\nThe Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal filed by Apple to overturn a stinging ruling that it led a broad conspiracy with several major publishers to fix the price of e-books sold through its online bookstore.\nThe court's decision means Apple now has no choice but to pay out $400 million to consumers and an additional $50 million in legal fees, according to the original settlement in 2014.\nSEE ALSO: Here's how Apple marshalled the entire tech industry in its fight with the FBI\nFor Apple, the final verdict is more damaging to its reputation as a consumer-friendly brand, not to mention the legacy of its beloved founder Steve Jobs, than to its actual bottom line.\nTo put the fine in context, the total $450 million payout is equal to about a little more than half the sales Apple generates on average each day, based on the $75.9 billion in revenue it reported in the most recent quarter.\nThe price-fixing episode dates back to late 2009, just ahead of the original iPad launch. Apple and its founder, recognizing that books would likely be a big selling point of the tablet, began courting what were then the big five book publishers.\nIn a series of e-mails, later released by the U.S. government, Jobs personally persuaded publishing industry executives to re-think the flat $9.99 e-book pricing previously imposed by Amazon, then (and now) the giant of the e-book world.\n\"All the major publishers tell us that Amazon’s $9.99 price for new releases is eroding the value perception of their products in customer’s minds, and they do not want this practice to continue for new releases.\" Jobs wrote in one email to James Murdoch, an executive at News Corp, which owns Harper Collins.\n\nAn email Apple CEO Steve Jobs sent to News Corp exec James Murdoch.Image:  screengrab,  mashableThe major publishers, unhappy about the unfavorable terms they'd agreed to with Amazon, signed on to Apple's plan and later used the new competition to pressure Amazon into changing its own pricing structure.\nWhile some in the publishing industry argued this move helped break up Amazon's potential monopoly on the market, the U.S. government accused Apple and the five publishers of colluding to keep prices high.\nThe publishers — Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon & Schuster — all settled with the Department of Justice before going to trial. \nOnly Apple, armed with the unwavering belief in its own rightness, argued the case in the courts. \n\"We are ready to distribute the court-mandated settlement funds to Kindle customers as soon as we’re instructed to move forward,\" a spokesperson for Amazon said in a statement provided to Mashable.\nReps for Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment on the Supreme Court decision. However, a company statement after its big loss in court in 2013 says it all. \n\"When we introduced the iBookstore in 2010, we gave customers more choice, injecting much needed innovation and competition into the market, breaking Amazon's monopolistic grip on the publishing industry,\" Apple said in a statement at the time. \"We've done nothing wrong.\"\nThe U.S. courts have once again determined otherwise.\n",

         "Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a reason that Donald Trump's outrageous statements and behavior feel familiar to many women. \nIt's not because they know his declarative style and trademark shrug from reality television or political debates. Nor is it because his outsized role in American business made an unforgettable impression on them.\nSEE ALSO: As Donald Trump targets women, Republicans say he could cost the party everything\nThe eerie familiarity is more personal than that. They know Trump because they've encountered a man like him at home, work, on social media or in a relationship. \nThis man extols the virtues of women, but has no problem reducing them to sex objects. He casts himself as unflappable, but blames a woman when his weaknesses are revealed. He insists on personal responsibility, but denies, deflects and perhaps even turns violent when accused of wrongdoing. \n\nThe media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2016\n\nThe psychological warfare of gaslighting, a subtle form of emotional abuse that puts the victim on the defensive, is his go-to strategy.    \nThis is not how Trump sees himself or his actions, but it is arguably the image he projects to voters. On Tuesday, when Florida police charged his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, with battery of a female reporter, Trump issued a series of tweets refuting the video evidence, discrediting the journalist and implying she could have been a dangerous or deadly threat. \n\nWow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016\n\nPowerful women on the left and right forcefully criticized Trump's reaction to the charges. \n“Too often victims of violence and abuse stay silent, and Donald Trump’s remarks today demonstrate one of the reasons why,\" Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. \"His actions today underscore that it is a fiction that he has been or would be supportive of any woman in this country.\"\n\nThis was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune. pic.twitter.com/N5815RS1At\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016\n\n\nWhy is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand?? pic.twitter.com/HQB8dl0fhn\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016\n\nOn Wednesday, a group of conservative female journalists and commentators called for Lewandowski's firing.\nTrump has a track record of making his female targets — and their defenders — seem like the foolish ones.\n\nNichole Bauer, assistant professor in the political science department at the University of Alabama, says the response was classic Trump. He's practiced at denying previous statements even when incontrovertible evidence of them exists. While this isn't exclusive to his commentary about women, Trump has a track record of making his female targets — and their defenders — seem like the foolish ones. \nOf course he wasn't making a reference to menstruation when he joked about Fox anchor Megyn Kelly having \"blood coming out of her wherever\" during a debate. And no, he most certainly did not use schlonged as a vulgar term when describing how badly Pres. Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. \n\nThe press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2016\n\n\"There’s definitely an accepted belief among the Republican and Democratic mainstream that this sort of outmoded sexism that Donald Trump demonstrates has no real place in discourse,\" says Bauer. \nYet, instead of apologizing, or acknowledging how the woman in question — or any woman, for that matter — might find his remarks offensive, Trump doubled down and obfuscated reality. \nMany women have been here before, whether it's with a coworker who denies the meaning of a sexist comment or a partner who is quick to end an argument by using the word emotional. \n...he's telling women that they don't deserve the same respect and agency as men.\nTrump's denials may make him appear unassailable to some, but to women they send an entirely different message, says Bauer. By denying the nature of his commentary and behavior, he's telling women that they don't deserve the same respect and agency as men. \nWhile Republican women tend to support traditional roles, Bauer says, they do so believing that deference to a male authority figure or husband is their choice. Trump's faultless behavior effectively takes that autonomy away from them by creating a political climate in which the woman is always wrong. \nThis may explain why he performed so poorly with Republican women in one recent survey. That NBC/WSJ poll found that 47% of female Republican primary voters cannot see themselves voting for Trump. His favorability ratings were higher, at 59%, amongst registered Republican women in a CNN/ORC poll, though it did not ask whether they intended to vote for him.\n\n\"@Don_Vito_08: \"A picture is worth a thousand words\" @realDonaldTrump #LyingTed #NeverCruz @MELANIATRUMP pic.twitter.com/5bvVEwMVF8\"\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2016\n\nThese polls also don't fully reflect his recent, unseemly attacks on Heidi Cruz, wife of his opponent Sen. Ted Cruz, or his statement on Wednesday that if abortion is banned, women who have one illegally should \"face some sort of punishment.\" \nThough Trump immediately clarified that comment as a response to a hypothetical question and then reversed his position, it's clear that he's not only willing to publicly embarrass and degrade women, but also consider depriving them of physical freedom. \nSuch power dynamics aren't hypothetical to women in abusive workplaces or relationships, who cannot fathom a political reality that mirrors their private hell. \n\"People are doing it as a strategy to control others and elevate themselves and insulate themselves from attack.\"\nJackie White, emerita professor of psychology and a senior research scientist at the Center for Women’s Health and Wellness at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, says an approach that victimizes women and then blames them for playing a part in their degradation is about manipulation. \n\"People are doing it as a strategy to control others and elevate themselves and insulate themselves from attack,\" she says. \"They’re going to present themselves as a very self-assured, knowledgable person.\" \nMeanwhile, such behavior silences the victim. She may feel depressed, passive or paralyzed. Feelings of doubt and insecurity set in. Women know this experience well, says White. \nShe worries, however, that the tactics on display in the campaign could send just as powerful a message to men as to women. \nTrump's behavior may consciously or subconsciously lead some men to endorse harmful stereotypes and engage in emotional manipulation, particularly if they feel threatened by social and demographic change and evolving gender roles.\n\"[Trump's] actions could inspire them to feel justified in clinging to what they see as their deserved elevated status,\" White says. \nThat's what makes Donald Trump so dangerous. Even if he's offering the public a performance, the fallout is unconscionable for both women and men. \n",

         "Today's digital marketing experts must have a diverse skill set, including a sophisticated grasp of available media channels, the ability to identify up-and-coming opportunities, on top of having the basic skills of a brilliant marketer. What's more, they have to possess a balance of critical and creative thinking skills in order to drive measurable success for their company.\nThat's why I asked 15 members of Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC) what they look for when hiring digital marketers. Their best answers are below.\n1. Paid social media advertising expertise\n\nA new digital marketing hire should be well-versed in paid social media advertising, especially through Facebook or a similar social platform that our company uses regularly. They need to be able to understand and implement Facebook analytics and insights, create \"lookalike\" and custom audiences, experiment and test creative campaign and images, and be secure in their knowledge of the overall social media landscape. There are many budget-saving opportunities within the social media advertising space, so we want to make sure that our digital marketing talent knows the ins and outs of this popular and easy-to-implement marketing space. \n— Miles Jennings, Recruiter.com\nSEE ALSO: Web developers, data scientists, AI experts: The 15 top tech roles of 2016\n\n2. Sales skills\n\nWe've hired many digital marketers over the years, both outsourced and in-house. What we've found is that people who have sold successfully are much better marketers. They know how to engage with people and turn them into sales opportunities. While your digital marketers may not be closing deals directly, they need to know how to sell or they'll be wasting your valuable marketing dollars without generating qualified lead opportunities for your sales team. \n— Mark Cenicola, BannerView.com\n3. Specific marketing channel expertise \n\nI see so many marketers who extol the virtues of every conceivable marketing channel: email, SEO, SEM, social, etc. And many channels might work for you, but the key to a successful marketing strategy is focusing on a few channels and using them really well. Often that means understanding the dynamics of that marketing channel deeply and leveraging those dynamics for your specific company. For example, in helping local businesses, Pinterest is less interesting (although it's one of the best drivers of ecommerce traffic). I'd much rather focus on the intricate tactics of local SEO to get a client to No. 1 on Google, Maps and Yelp.\n— Trevor Sumner, LocalVox\n4. The ability to think objectively \n\nMarketers are usually one of the most passionate workers in the office. However, that passion can often cloud the judgment and measurement of marketing theories and initiatives. A marketer who can separate themselves from their work will navigate with an objective eye that can focus on what actually works — not just what they hoped would work.\n— Wesley Mathews, High Level Marketing\n5. The ability to execute and analyze drip marketing campaigns\n\nInbound marketing is a key skill in driving lead generation. While many marketers can come up with an initial innovative engagement strategy or CPC campaign, what intrigues me more is how they examine the incoming data and create a robust drip marketing campaign. Great automation on these campaigns is not about sending the same email to the entire flock that the campaign gathers. It's about personal, well-written communication that varies depending on the actions performed seven emails deep into the campaign. That's a lot of variation, and requires an analytical mindset and strategic thinking. Exceptional marketing happens when the art of communication expands upon the fundamental science of conversion. \n— Eran Eyal, Springleap \nSEE ALSO: 11 things your startup should look for in a creative hire for 2016\n\n6. A mix of creativity and analytical abilities\n\nDigital marketing requires both creative thinking and analytical thinking, so we look for a candidate capable of and excited about both. Many new candidates want to focus purely on one or the other, but it's important to bring \"art and science\" to each digital program. Digital marketing allows us to be very measurable — even for beautiful creative campaigns — using analytics to inform future strategies. \n— Kayla Wagner Faires, Revel Interactive\n7. Good copy and visual storytelling abilities \n\nDigital media is a copy- and visual-driven medium unlike any other before it. Our social heart is won over (or double clicked on) by copy that is relevant and visuals that pull on our emotional strings. The native understanding and ability to manipulate those two elements is critical in today's digital marketing landscape. \n— Alex Frias, Track Marketing Group\n8. A likable personality\n\nRelationship building is such a huge component of digital marketing, and a likable personality can go a long way. With so many people trying to connect with publishers, bloggers, journalists and influencers, someone with a great personality will always stand out and command attention. If you are being pitched by two similar people and one person is the equivalent to talking to a brick wall and the other person is outgoing and pleasant, who are you going to give your time to? The same applies to maintaining relationships — having a likable personality plays such a huge role, yet it's often overlooked. \n— Jonathan Long, Market Domination Media\nSEE ALSO: 14 mobile marketing trends that will dominate in 2016\n\n9. An understanding of WordPress\n\nWith so many platforms now built on WordPress, it is a vital technical tool to add to your toolbox. If you want to create and manage a blog or even a website, WordPress has become the go-to platform for digital marketers. It also helps to continually educate yourself on new plug-ins and functionality because WordPress is always offering something new and useful that speeds up content production. \n— Angela Ruth, Due.com \n10. Self-promotion savvy \n\nIf you're telling me that you have a strong understanding of social media and leveraging brands, then it should be very easy for you to do the same with your own. My interviewees are their own first project, and I use information I can find on them to make my final decision. Something should come up when I search their names, preferably on all the same platforms that I want to use for my clients. Messaging and vis-a-vis skills should be consistent across most platforms, and some obvious care should be put into the presentation and expansion of each one.\n— Adam Steele, The Magistrate\n11. Understanding of brevity\n\nIt doesn't matter how good your product is if you can't communicate your value proposition to potential customers in fewer than 140 characters. Digital marketers must be efficient and effective with minimal messaging. \n— Nicholas Haase, Loot!\n12. The ability to analyze quantifiable metrics\n\nNow, more than ever, being able to quantify the value of investing in marketing and advertising is vital. The battle for supremacy in the marketplace is not won in whole percentage points any longer. It's about making the right choices and moving the needle slightly forward at every opportunity. Digital marketing consultants need to possess the competencies and the general knowledge required to provide actionable metrics, and prove their value with real data. Gone are the days of guessing whether or not a campaign was effective based on simple sales numbers. In-page tracking, coupled with analytics and metrics software are the tools of the day for marketers, and we expect any new consultants or team members to be able to leverage those tools to ensure accuracy and efficacy.\n— Blair Thomas, EMerchantBroker\nSee also: Top 11 digital advertising strategies you should use for mobile\n13. Listening skills\n\nAs a digital marketer, our ability to promote our services through words, images, video and social media are essential. Digital marketing also provides an opportunity for its specialists to listen to various groups of people, from clients to consumers, in new ways. Through social media and analytical tools, we can listen to our consumers' thoughts on a product, relevant issue or our own services. When I hire a digital marketer, I'll see if they've sought to listen to consumer and client needs and create a solution from their own observations or insights. \n— Shalyn Dever, Chatter Buzz\n14. Agility\n\nAt least once a month a new platform pushes its way into relevancy, or a major platform adjusts its algorithm. If you're/they're operating on a methodology devised without flexibility, and/or aren't the type of person to be able to react appropriately, you and your business will fall behind the curve and lose ground fast. \n— Mickey Meyer, JASH\n15. Basic design skills\n\nBeing able to communicate a message properly is extremely important. However, digital marketing involves more than just words. A large part of digital marketing is about visual appearance. Anyone who calls themselves a digital marketer should have at least some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS or Photoshop. \n— Dan Sapozhnikov, AdGate Media\nScott GerberScott Gerber is a serial entrepreneur, author (Never Get a 'Real' Job), TV commentator and founder of Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC), an invite-only organization comprised of the world's most promising young entrepreneur...More\n\n\n\nTopics:\nBusiness, career advice, cover letter, digital marketing, job hunt, Jobs, Marketing, Media, resume, Social Media, Work & Play, yec\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  if(window.pageChanged)\n    window.omni({\"channel\":\"business\",\"content_type\":\"article\",\"v_buy\":null,\"v_buy_i\":null,\"h_pub\":655.0,\"h_buy\":null,\"h_pub_buy\":null,\"v_cur\":1.6,\"v_max\":1.6,\"v_cur_i\":1,\"v_max_i\":1,\"events\":\"event51,event61\",\"top_channel\":\"business\",\"content_source_type\":\"Internal\",\"content_source_name\":\"Internal\",\"author_name\":\"Scott Gerber\",\"age\":\"27\",\"pub_day\":8,\"pub_month\":3,\"pub_year\":2016,\"pub_date\":\"03/08/2016\",\"sourced_from\":\"Internal\",\"isPostView\":true,\"post_lead_type\":\"Default\",\"topics\":\"Business,career advice,cover letter,digital marketing,job hunt,Jobs,Marketing,Media,resume,Social Media,Uncategorized,Work &amp;

         "LOS ANGELES — For big, fun, populist popcorn movies, 2015 was a grand fireworks show with a blowout finale. For quiet adult dramas and prestige films, it started with a pop … and ended in a fizzle.\nThat’s why I struggled mightily to fill out a Top 10 for 2015, the biggest year ever at the North American box office. It’s also why this list is overwhelmed with blockbusters and populist hits.\nSEE ALSO: Diversity report card: The film industry took 1 step forward, 2 steps back\nAnd none packed more firepower than Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Mashable’s No. 1 movie of the year. Using a “best-in-show” mentality — that the biggest prize goes to the most fulfilling representation of its breed — there really is no contest in the Year of the Blockbuster.\nAs for the rest, well … I asked Mashable’s fellow film buffs to help weigh in, because frankly, though I saw more movies this year than any other, I couldn’t come up with 10 films from 2015 that I loved enough to grant year-end-best honors.\nThere were many titles that walked up to the line: The Revenant, Carol, Anomalisa, Creed and Ex Machina were all on the bubble, and I’d hoped my colleagues' enthusiasm might push them over the line. It didn’t. (They did, however, rescue The Martian and The Big Short, films I liked very much but didn’t love-love.)\nI’m not declaring 2015 a bad year for movies (I did that last year, and stand by it). It was just a lopsided one, a year in which the truly best films were also the biggest. Without a single major indie or “prestige” breakout at the box office, audiences clearly agreed.\nAll of that in mind, here's Mashable’s Top 10 for 2015:\nNo. 1: Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n\nDeeply, deeply conflicted about this movie, I am. \nIt's a remix of Star Wars: A New Hope, right down to its ships and vehicles, which puzzlingly have not evolved since their 1977 models. Neither have the costumes, the hairstyles, the weaponry, the MacGuffins, the major plot points or the presence of that one portly X-Wing pilot.\nDisney and Lucasfilm basically recreated your old bedroom for you but put some awesome new toys in it, and the strategy could not have been more effective. For all its glaring faults, The Force Awakens was breathless fun to watch and re-watch, it made us talk and feel and tweet and write endlessly, it will make $1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 at the box office — and it did so with two unknown actors in lead roles. \nWhat did you think was the best movie of 2015? If your answer was anything but Star Wars: The Force Awakens, try again. What other movie surrounds us, binds us, and brings us together? Said my colleague Adam Rosenberg: \"I saw someone say the tacit social media ban on Star Wars spoilers is the closest we got to world peace in 2015. They're not wrong.\"\nNo. 2: Spotlight\n\nThe biggest exception to the \"Year of Blockbusters\" is Spotlight, the presumptive front-runner for the Best Picture Oscar, and for good reason. \nNothing at all fancy here: Just a handful of our best actors digging into a great script. Lean, focused and exciting, this portrait of the Boston Globe's Pulitzer Prize-winning stories exposing systematic sexual abuse in the Catholic Church played more like a heist thriller. \nAnd it isn't just a Thing Journalists Like. Said my colleague Megan Hess: \"Beyond giving media folks a more modern movie reference than All The President's Men, this film showed the power of questioning things around you — which is, frankly, something we should all be doing more of.\"\nSEE ALSO: 'Spotlight' movie review: A thrilling dive into masterful journalism\nNo. 3: Inside Out\n\nIn terms of developing \"emotional intelligence,\" Inside Out was better than a year's worth of therapy sessions. \nPete Docter's vision of making emotions into characters was too daring, too out-there to be this clear in its purpose. And the payoff — that all the emotions are valuable, even the unpleasant ones — actually changed my life in a meaningful way. On some deep, resonant level, this was my No. 1 movie of 2015, and certainly one of my all-time favorites, period.\nSEE ALSO: 'Inside Out' review: You will walk out of the theater knowing yourself better \nNo. 4: Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nThe consensus No. 1 among critics and movie bloggers deserves its place there; in terms of pure auteurism, George Miller hits the gas and runs away with 2015's most compelling theater-going experience, period. \nThis budget-busting, deeply \"troubled\" retread of an aging franchise should have been a disaster. It wasn't. Instead, we got the freshest-looking hero/heroine flick of the decade. \nBumped down a few spots on my list for its thin \"drive away, drive back\" storyline, but that's not a knock. Said my colleague Kate Sommers-Dawes: \"That was a totally unexpected, shiny-and-chrome thrill. I laughed, I cried, I rejoiced at the feminist utopia suggested by the last scene. Also probably a preview of a Donald Trump presidency so ... start your water hoarding now.\"\nSEE ALSO: 'Mad Max: Fury Road' Review: Drive like hell to see this Maxterpiece\nNo. 5: Straight Outta Compton\n\nF. Gary Gray's film about the rise of N.W.A. was sharp, propulsive, brisk and brash — so much so that to hang \"biopic\" on this one seems ... off. \nStandout performances from O'Shea Jackson Jr., Jason Mitchell and Corey Hawkins earned this one a Screen Actors Guild nomination for ensemble, and it's criminal that none of these guys seems to be seriously contending for an Oscar. And at  $161 million in North America, audiences also thought that shit was doooooope.\nSEE ALSO: 'Straight Outta Compton' review: Hip-hop nostalgia goes Hollywood\nNo. 6: The Martian\n\nEverybody loves The Martian. I thought it was good, clean, forgettable fun — nothing about its themes stirred me — but it's more or less a unanimous choice among my colleagues and peers. So here it is.\nSEE ALSO: 'The Martian' review: Matt Damon, and the movie, are stellar\nNo. 7: Ant-Man\n\nMarvel showed another, funnier side with Ant-Man, establishing a new comic-relief character — and probably just in time, as a palate cleanser to the cool but often wearisome Avengers: Age of Ultron. Ant-Man works as a piece of the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe, but also makes for a fun, silly one-off, to the tune of half-a-billion dollars worldwide. \nSEE ALSO: 'Ant-Man' review: Earth's tiniest hero is also Marvel's funniest movie\nNo. 8: The Big Short\n\nAnother one voted in by my colleagues. I thoroughly enjoyed The Big Short and certainly learned something from it, but its ensemble of middle-aged white dudes, explanatory hurdles and hinky edits didn't scream \"Top 10\" to me. But definitely worth your time — and should have a second life in high-school economics classes as an annual watch when the teacher is out sick.\nSEE ALSO: 'The Big Short' review: The crippling housing crash never looked so ... funny\nNo. 9: Dope\n\nI loved this movie, despite it being about 30 minutes too long. Some called it \"John Hughes in the Hood,\" and I'm buying that distillation — the characters felt real, their predicaments felt real, the story felt real, and yet everything was utterly absurd and over the top. With clever nods to popular culture across at least three decades and a deeply satisfying payoff, Dope would've charted a lot higher in my personal Top 10.\nSEE ALSO: 'Dope' just blew up Sundance\nNo. 10: While We’re Young\n\nThe tension between Gen X and Millennials is real, it's widespread, and it's never been more accurately or hilariously depicted than in Noah Baumbach's While We're Young. I like Baumbach — he's quietly becoming our Woody Allen/Mike Nichols — but I was caught completely off-guard by how much I loved While We're Young, which skewers both generations pointedly but without bitterness. \nEveryone else loved these films — they just didn’t make the cut for me\nCarol: Strong contender for just about every Oscar there is, and deservedly so; it just left me slightly cold. Really nothing to criticize, except maybe the gratuitous puking scene.\nThe Revenant: Gorgeous, made with incredible skill, but only enjoyable as a one-off cinematic experience. I enjoyed every minute, and have no desire — nay, no need whatsoever — to ever see this again.\nAnomalisa: Charlie Kaufman's animated movie is a mini-marvel. The puppets are, in some ways, more human than humans; the interior of the hotel looks more like a hotel than a real-life hotel. The whole thing has something very striking to say about the frailty of human desire. This should probably be in the Top 10.\nEx Machina: A near-masterpiece that was undone by its jarring, oblique ending.\nCreed: We can all agree that Ryan Coogler is one of the best young directors in Hollywood and Creed was a bona fide hit, both critically and commercially. But boxing hasn't looked this cartoonish since ... well, the original Rocky films. There are at least 25 hits in this movie that would end any given match in real-life. I just can't let that pass.\nHateful Eight: Quentin Tarantino's apparent homage to John Carpenter's The Thing could've been the greatest 90 minutes in 2015. Instead, the distraction of road-show bells and whistles (70mm projection, overture, intermission), a few overly hammy performances and at least a full hour of fat made this one a slog to sit through.\nRoom: Easily my least favorite film of 2015. Exploitative, manipulative, cloying, suffocating. I nearly left the theater 20 minutes in, and now I wish I had. The confinement section was a dreary hell; the \"escape\" scene was clumsy and sloppily executed; the life-after-escape was draggy and hopeless. \nNot nearly as bad as advertised\nJupiter Ascending: The Wachowskis' gorgeous visuals and a unique take on our place in the galaxy were undermined by a few things, not the least of which is bad casting: Mila Kunis is a star, she's just not an intergalactic queen. And Channing Tatum's doggyness was plain silly.\nEntourage: Movie based on TV show turns out like that TV show, everyone gets mad? That makes no sense to me, and I'm no Entourage fan, but there was nothing worse about this movie than its source material.\nVacation: This movie made me laugh out loud at least 20 times, and the Tartan Prancer is my favorite comedic character of the year. \nBy the Sea: Angelina Jolie's attempt at an arthouse film is gorgeous and weird. Angelina Jolie is gorgeous and weird. That's just math.\nDefinitely as bad as advertised\nTomorrowland: Ugh.Terminator: Genisys: Ugh.Pixels: UGH.Fantastic Four: Oof.American Ultra: Seriously.\nSo bad that it gets its own category\nPan: \"So resoundingly awful that you have to see it.\"\n*Disclosure: I have yet to see these films, which fell on many critics' Top 10 lists: Brooklyn, Diary of a Teenage Girl, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, Sicario, Trumbo, Joy.\nHave something to say about this story?

       "'Analysis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is a reason that\\xa0Donald Trump\\'s\\xa0outrageous statements and behavior feel familiar to many women.\\xa0\\nIt\\'s not because they know his declarative style and trademark shrug from reality television or political debates. Nor is it because his outsized role in American business made an unforgettable impression on them.\\nSEE ALSO: As Donald Trump targets women, Republicans say he could cost the party everything\\nThe eerie familiarity is more personal than that. They know Trump because they\\'ve encountered a man like him at home, work, on social media or in a relationship.\\xa0\\nThis man extols the virtues of women, but has no problem reducing them to sex objects. He casts himself as unflappable, but blames a woman when his weaknesses are revealed. He insists on personal responsibility, but denies, deflects and perhaps even turns violent when accused of wrongdoing.\\xa0\\n\\nThe media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2016\\n\\nThe psychological warfare of gaslighting, a subtle form of emotional abuse that puts the victim on the defensive, is his go-to strategy.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is not how Trump sees himself or his actions, but it is arguably the image he projects to voters.\\xa0On Tuesday, when Florida police charged his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, with battery of a female reporter, Trump issued a series of tweets refuting the video evidence, discrediting the journalist and implying she could have been a dangerous or deadly threat.\\xa0\\n\\nWow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016\\n\\nPowerful women on the left and right forcefully criticized Trump\\'s reaction to the charges. \\n“Too often victims of violence and abuse stay silent, and Donald Trump’s remarks today demonstrate one of the reasons why,\" Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. \"His actions today underscore that it is a fiction that he has been or would be supportive of any woman in this country.\"\\n\\nThis was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune. pic.twitter.com/N5815RS1At\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016\\n\\n\\nWhy is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand?? pic.twitter.com/HQB8dl0fhn\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016\\n\\nOn Wednesday, a group of conservative female journalists and commentators called for Lewandowski\\'s firing.\\nTrump has a track record of making his female targets — and their defenders — seem like the foolish ones.\\n\\nNichole Bauer, assistant professor in the political science department at the University of Alabama, says the response was classic Trump. He\\'s practiced at denying previous statements even when\\xa0incontrovertible\\xa0evidence of them exists. While this isn\\'t exclusive to his commentary about women, Trump has a track record of making his female targets — and their defenders — seem like the foolish ones.\\xa0\\nOf course he wasn\\'t making a reference to menstruation when he joked about\\xa0Fox anchor Megyn Kelly having \"blood coming out of her wherever\" during a debate. And no, he most certainly did not use schlonged as a vulgar term when describing how badly Pres. Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary.\\xa0\\n\\nThe press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite!\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2016\\n\\n\"There’s definitely an accepted belief among the Republican and Democratic mainstream that this sort of outmoded sexism that Donald Trump demonstrates has no real place in discourse,\" says Bauer.\\xa0\\nYet, instead of apologizing, or acknowledging how the woman in question — or any woman, for that matter — might find his remarks offensive, Trump doubled down and obfuscated reality.\\xa0\\nMany women have been here before, whether it\\'s with a coworker who denies the meaning of a sexist comment or a partner who is quick to end an argument by using the word emotional.\\xa0\\n...he\\'s telling women that they don\\'t deserve the same respect and agency as men.\\nTrump\\'s denials may make him appear unassailable to some, but to women they send an entirely different message, says Bauer. By denying the nature of his commentary and behavior, he\\'s telling women that they don\\'t deserve the same respect and agency as men.\\xa0\\nWhile Republican women tend to support traditional roles, Bauer says, they do so believing that deference to a male authority figure or husband is their choice. Trump\\'s faultless behavior effectively takes that autonomy away from them by creating a political climate in which the woman is always wrong.\\xa0\\nThis may\\xa0explain why he performed so poorly with Republican women in one recent survey. That\\xa0NBC/WSJ poll found that 47% of female Republican primary voters cannot see themselves voting for Trump. His favorability ratings were higher, at 59%, amongst registered Republican women in a\\xa0CNN/ORC poll, though it did not ask whether they intended to vote for him.\\n\\n\"@Don_Vito_08: \"A picture is worth a thousand words\" @realDonaldTrump #LyingTed #NeverCruz @MELANIATRUMP pic.twitter.com/5bvVEwMVF8\"\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2016\\n\\nThese polls also don\\'t fully reflect his\\xa0recent, unseemly attacks on Heidi Cruz, wife of his opponent Sen. Ted Cruz, or his statement on Wednesday that if abortion is banned, women who have one illegally should \"face some sort of punishment.\"\\xa0\\nThough Trump immediately clarified that comment as a response to a hypothetical question and then reversed his position, it\\'s clear that he\\'s not only willing to publicly embarrass and degrade women, but also consider\\xa0depriving them of physical\\xa0freedom.\\xa0\\nSuch power dynamics aren\\'t hypothetical to women in abusive workplaces or relationships, who cannot fathom a political reality that mirrors their private hell.\\xa0\\n\"People are doing it as a strategy to control others and elevate themselves and insulate themselves from attack.\"\\nJackie White, emerita professor of psychology and a senior research scientist at the Center for Women’s Health and Wellness at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, says an approach that victimizes women and then blames them for playing a part in their degradation is about manipulation.\\xa0\\n\"People are doing it as a strategy to control others and elevate themselves and insulate themselves from attack,\" she says. \"They’re going to present themselves as a very self-assured, knowledgable person.\"\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, such behavior silences the victim. She may feel depressed, passive or paralyzed. Feelings of doubt and insecurity set in. Women know this experience well, says White.\\xa0\\nShe worries, however, that the tactics on display in the\\xa0campaign could send just as powerful a message to men as to women.\\xa0\\nTrump\\'s behavior may consciously or\\xa0subconsciously\\xa0lead some men to\\xa0endorse harmful stereotypes and engage in emotional manipulation, particularly if they feel threatened by social and demographic change and evolving gender roles.\\n\"[Trump\\'s] actions could inspire them to feel justified in clinging to what they see as their deserved elevated status,\" White says.\\xa0\\nThat\\'s what makes Donald Trump so dangerous. Even if he\\'s offering the public a performance, the fallout is unconscionable for both women and men.\\xa0\\n'"

         "\nApple's long and controversial ebook case has reached its final chapter — and it's not the happy ending the company wanted.\nThe Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal filed by Apple to overturn a stinging ruling that it led a broad conspiracy with several major publishers to fix the price of e-books sold through its online bookstore.\nThe court's decision means Apple now has no choice but to pay out $400 million to consumers and an additional $50 million in legal fees, according to the original settlement in 2014.\nSEE ALSO: Here's how Apple marshalled the entire tech industry in its fight with the FBI\nFor Apple, the final verdict is more damaging to its reputation as a consumer-friendly brand, not to mention the legacy of its beloved founder Steve Jobs, than to its actual bottom line.\nTo put the fine in context, the total $450 million payout is equal to about a little more than half the sales Apple generates on average each day, based on the $75.9 billion in revenue it reported in the most recent quarter.\nThe price-fixing episode dates back to late 2009, just ahead of the original iPad launch. Apple and its founder, recognizing that books would likely be a big selling point of the tablet, began courting what were then the big five book publishers.\nIn a series of e-mails, later released by the U.S. government, Jobs personally persuaded publishing industry executives to re-think the flat $9.99 e-book pricing previously imposed by Amazon, then (and now) the giant of the e-book world.\n\"All the major publishers tell us that Amazon’s $9.99 price for new releases is eroding the value perception of their products in customer’s minds, and they do not want this practice to continue for new releases.\" Jobs wrote in one email to James Murdoch, an executive at News Corp, which owns Harper Collins.\n\nAn email Apple CEO Steve Jobs sent to News Corp exec James Murdoch.Image:  screengrab,  mashableThe major publishers, unhappy about the unfavorable terms they'd agreed to with Amazon, signed on to Apple's plan and later used the new competition to pressure Amazon into changing its own pricing structure.\nWhile some in the publishing industry argued this move helped break up Amazon's potential monopoly on the market, the U.S. government accused Apple and the five publishers of colluding to keep prices high.\nThe publishers — Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon & Schuster — all settled with the Department of Justice before going to trial. \nOnly Apple, armed with the unwavering belief in its own rightness, argued the case in the courts. \n\"We are ready to distribute the court-mandated settlement funds to Kindle customers as soon as we’re instructed to move forward,\" a spokesperson for Amazon said in a statement provided to Mashable.\nReps for Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment on the Supreme Court decision. However, a company statement after its big loss in court in 2013 says it all. \n\"When we introduced the iBookstore in 2010, we gave customers more choice, injecting much needed innovation and competition into the market, breaking Amazon's monopolistic grip on the publishing industry,\" Apple said in a statement at the time. \"We've done nothing wrong.\"\nThe U.S. courts have once again determined otherwise.\n",

         "Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a reason that Donald Trump's outrageous statements and behavior feel familiar to many women. \nIt's not because they know his declarative style and trademark shrug from reality television or political debates. Nor is it because his outsized role in American business made an unforgettable impression on them.\nSEE ALSO: As Donald Trump targets women, Republicans say he could cost the party everything\nThe eerie familiarity is more personal than that. They know Trump because they've encountered a man like him at home, work, on social media or in a relationship. \nThis man extols the virtues of women, but has no problem reducing them to sex objects. He casts himself as unflappable, but blames a woman when his weaknesses are revealed. He insists on personal responsibility, but denies, deflects and perhaps even turns violent when accused of wrongdoing. \n\nThe media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2016\n\nThe psychological warfare of gaslighting, a subtle form of emotional abuse that puts the victim on the defensive, is his go-to strategy.    \nThis is not how Trump sees himself or his actions, but it is arguably the image he projects to voters. On Tuesday, when Florida police charged his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, with battery of a female reporter, Trump issued a series of tweets refuting the video evidence, discrediting the journalist and implying she could have been a dangerous or deadly threat. \n\nWow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016\n\nPowerful women on the left and right forcefully criticized Trump's reaction to the charges. \n“Too often victims of violence and abuse stay silent, and Donald Trump’s remarks today demonstrate one of the reasons why,\" Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. \"His actions today underscore that it is a fiction that he has been or would be supportive of any woman in this country.\"\n\nThis was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune. pic.twitter.com/N5815RS1At\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016\n\n\nWhy is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand?? pic.twitter.com/HQB8dl0fhn\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016\n\nOn Wednesday, a group of conservative female journalists and commentators called for Lewandowski's firing.\nTrump has a track record of making his female targets — and their defenders — seem like the foolish ones.\n\nNichole Bauer, assistant professor in the political science department at the University of Alabama, says the response was classic Trump. He's practiced at denying previous statements even when incontrovertible evidence of them exists. While this isn't exclusive to his commentary about women, Trump has a track record of making his female targets — and their defenders — seem like the foolish ones. \nOf course he wasn't making a reference to menstruation when he joked about Fox anchor Megyn Kelly having \"blood coming out of her wherever\" during a debate. And no, he most certainly did not use schlonged as a vulgar term when describing how badly Pres. Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. \n\nThe press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2016\n\n\"There’s definitely an accepted belief among the Republican and Democratic mainstream that this sort of outmoded sexism that Donald Trump demonstrates has no real place in discourse,\" says Bauer. \nYet, instead of apologizing, or acknowledging how the woman in question — or any woman, for that matter — might find his remarks offensive, Trump doubled down and obfuscated reality. \nMany women have been here before, whether it's with a coworker who denies the meaning of a sexist comment or a partner who is quick to end an argument by using the word emotional. \n...he's telling women that they don't deserve the same respect and agency as men.\nTrump's denials may make him appear unassailable to some, but to women they send an entirely different message, says Bauer. By denying the nature of his commentary and behavior, he's telling women that they don't deserve the same respect and agency as men. \nWhile Republican women tend to support traditional roles, Bauer says, they do so believing that deference to a male authority figure or husband is their choice. Trump's faultless behavior effectively takes that autonomy away from them by creating a political climate in which the woman is always wrong. \nThis may explain why he performed so poorly with Republican women in one recent survey. That NBC/WSJ poll found that 47% of female Republican primary voters cannot see themselves voting for Trump. His favorability ratings were higher, at 59%, amongst registered Republican women in a CNN/ORC poll, though it did not ask whether they intended to vote for him.\n\n\"@Don_Vito_08: \"A picture is worth a thousand words\" @realDonaldTrump #LyingTed #NeverCruz @MELANIATRUMP pic.twitter.com/5bvVEwMVF8\"\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2016\n\nThese polls also don't fully reflect his recent, unseemly attacks on Heidi Cruz, wife of his opponent Sen. Ted Cruz, or his statement on Wednesday that if abortion is banned, women who have one illegally should \"face some sort of punishment.\" \nThough Trump immediately clarified that comment as a response to a hypothetical question and then reversed his position, it's clear that he's not only willing to publicly embarrass and degrade women, but also consider depriving them of physical freedom. \nSuch power dynamics aren't hypothetical to women in abusive workplaces or relationships, who cannot fathom a political reality that mirrors their private hell. \n\"People are doing it as a strategy to control others and elevate themselves and insulate themselves from attack.\"\nJackie White, emerita professor of psychology and a senior research scientist at the Center for Women’s Health and Wellness at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, says an approach that victimizes women and then blames them for playing a part in their degradation is about manipulation. \n\"People are doing it as a strategy to control others and elevate themselves and insulate themselves from attack,\" she says. \"They’re going to present themselves as a very self-assured, knowledgable person.\" \nMeanwhile, such behavior silences the victim. She may feel depressed, passive or paralyzed. Feelings of doubt and insecurity set in. Women know this experience well, says White. \nShe worries, however, that the tactics on display in the campaign could send just as powerful a message to men as to women. \nTrump's behavior may consciously or subconsciously lead some men to endorse harmful stereotypes and engage in emotional manipulation, particularly if they feel threatened by social and demographic change and evolving gender roles.\n\"[Trump's] actions could inspire them to feel justified in clinging to what they see as their deserved elevated status,\" White says. \nThat's what makes Donald Trump so dangerous. Even if he's offering the public a performance, the fallout is unconscionable for both women and men. \n",

         "Today's digital marketing experts must have a diverse skill set, including a sophisticated grasp of available media channels, the ability to identify up-and-coming opportunities, on top of having the basic skills of a brilliant marketer. What's more, they have to possess a balance of critical and creative thinking skills in order to drive measurable success for their company.\nThat's why I asked 15 members of Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC) what they look for when hiring digital marketers. Their best answers are below.\n1. Paid social media advertising expertise\n\nA new digital marketing hire should be well-versed in paid social media advertising, especially through Facebook or a similar social platform that our company uses regularly. They need to be able to understand and implement Facebook analytics and insights, create \"lookalike\" and custom audiences, experiment and test creative campaign and images, and be secure in their knowledge of the overall social media landscape. There are many budget-saving opportunities within the social media advertising space, so we want to make sure that our digital marketing talent knows the ins and outs of this popular and easy-to-implement marketing space. \n— Miles Jennings, Recruiter.com\nSEE ALSO: Web developers, data scientists, AI experts: The 15 top tech roles of 2016\n\n2. Sales skills\n\nWe've hired many digital marketers over the years, both outsourced and in-house. What we've found is that people who have sold successfully are much better marketers. They know how to engage with people and turn them into sales opportunities. While your digital marketers may not be closing deals directly, they need to know how to sell or they'll be wasting your valuable marketing dollars without generating qualified lead opportunities for your sales team. \n— Mark Cenicola, BannerView.com\n3. Specific marketing channel expertise \n\nI see so many marketers who extol the virtues of every conceivable marketing channel: email, SEO, SEM, social, etc. And many channels might work for you, but the key to a successful marketing strategy is focusing on a few channels and using them really well. Often that means understanding the dynamics of that marketing channel deeply and leveraging those dynamics for your specific company. For example, in helping local businesses, Pinterest is less interesting (although it's one of the best drivers of ecommerce traffic). I'd much rather focus on the intricate tactics of local SEO to get a client to No. 1 on Google, Maps and Yelp.\n— Trevor Sumner, LocalVox\n4. The ability to think objectively \n\nMarketers are usually one of the most passionate workers in the office. However, that passion can often cloud the judgment and measurement of marketing theories and initiatives. A marketer who can separate themselves from their work will navigate with an objective eye that can focus on what actually works — not just what they hoped would work.\n— Wesley Mathews, High Level Marketing\n5. The ability to execute and analyze drip marketing campaigns\n\nInbound marketing is a key skill in driving lead generation. While many marketers can come up with an initial innovative engagement strategy or CPC campaign, what intrigues me more is how they examine the incoming data and create a robust drip marketing campaign. Great automation on these campaigns is not about sending the same email to the entire flock that the campaign gathers. It's about personal, well-written communication that varies depending on the actions performed seven emails deep into the campaign. That's a lot of variation, and requires an analytical mindset and strategic thinking. Exceptional marketing happens when the art of communication expands upon the fundamental science of conversion. \n— Eran Eyal, Springleap \nSEE ALSO: 11 things your startup should look for in a creative hire for 2016\n\n6. A mix of creativity and analytical abilities\n\nDigital marketing requires both creative thinking and analytical thinking, so we look for a candidate capable of and excited about both. Many new candidates want to focus purely on one or the other, but it's important to bring \"art and science\" to each digital program. Digital marketing allows us to be very measurable — even for beautiful creative campaigns — using analytics to inform future strategies. \n— Kayla Wagner Faires, Revel Interactive\n7. Good copy and visual storytelling abilities \n\nDigital media is a copy- and visual-driven medium unlike any other before it. Our social heart is won over (or double clicked on) by copy that is relevant and visuals that pull on our emotional strings. The native understanding and ability to manipulate those two elements is critical in today's digital marketing landscape. \n— Alex Frias, Track Marketing Group\n8. A likable personality\n\nRelationship building is such a huge component of digital marketing, and a likable personality can go a long way. With so many people trying to connect with publishers, bloggers, journalists and influencers, someone with a great personality will always stand out and command attention. If you are being pitched by two similar people and one person is the equivalent to talking to a brick wall and the other person is outgoing and pleasant, who are you going to give your time to? The same applies to maintaining relationships — having a likable personality plays such a huge role, yet it's often overlooked. \n— Jonathan Long, Market Domination Media\nSEE ALSO: 14 mobile marketing trends that will dominate in 2016\n\n9. An understanding of WordPress\n\nWith so many platforms now built on WordPress, it is a vital technical tool to add to your toolbox. If you want to create and manage a blog or even a website, WordPress has become the go-to platform for digital marketers. It also helps to continually educate yourself on new plug-ins and functionality because WordPress is always offering something new and useful that speeds up content production. \n— Angela Ruth, Due.com \n10. Self-promotion savvy \n\nIf you're telling me that you have a strong understanding of social media and leveraging brands, then it should be very easy for you to do the same with your own. My interviewees are their own first project, and I use information I can find on them to make my final decision. Something should come up when I search their names, preferably on all the same platforms that I want to use for my clients. Messaging and vis-a-vis skills should be consistent across most platforms, and some obvious care should be put into the presentation and expansion of each one.\n— Adam Steele, The Magistrate\n11. Understanding of brevity\n\nIt doesn't matter how good your product is if you can't communicate your value proposition to potential customers in fewer than 140 characters. Digital marketers must be efficient and effective with minimal messaging. \n— Nicholas Haase, Loot!\n12. The ability to analyze quantifiable metrics\n\nNow, more than ever, being able to quantify the value of investing in marketing and advertising is vital. The battle for supremacy in the marketplace is not won in whole percentage points any longer. It's about making the right choices and moving the needle slightly forward at every opportunity. Digital marketing consultants need to possess the competencies and the general knowledge required to provide actionable metrics, and prove their value with real data. Gone are the days of guessing whether or not a campaign was effective based on simple sales numbers. In-page tracking, coupled with analytics and metrics software are the tools of the day for marketers, and we expect any new consultants or team members to be able to leverage those tools to ensure accuracy and efficacy.\n— Blair Thomas, EMerchantBroker\nSee also: Top 11 digital advertising strategies you should use for mobile\n13. Listening skills\n\nAs a digital marketer, our ability to promote our services through words, images, video and social media are essential. Digital marketing also provides an opportunity for its specialists to listen to various groups of people, from clients to consumers, in new ways. Through social media and analytical tools, we can listen to our consumers' thoughts on a product, relevant issue or our own services. When I hire a digital marketer, I'll see if they've sought to listen to consumer and client needs and create a solution from their own observations or insights. \n— Shalyn Dever, Chatter Buzz\n14. Agility\n\nAt least once a month a new platform pushes its way into relevancy, or a major platform adjusts its algorithm. If you're/they're operating on a methodology devised without flexibility, and/or aren't the type of person to be able to react appropriately, you and your business will fall behind the curve and lose ground fast. \n— Mickey Meyer, JASH\n15. Basic design skills\n\nBeing able to communicate a message properly is extremely important. However, digital marketing involves more than just words. A large part of digital marketing is about visual appearance. Anyone who calls themselves a digital marketer should have at least some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS or Photoshop. \n— Dan Sapozhnikov, AdGate Media\nScott GerberScott Gerber is a serial entrepreneur, author (Never Get a 'Real' Job), TV commentator and founder of Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC), an invite-only organization comprised of the world's most promising young entrepreneur...More\n\n\n\nTopics:\nBusiness, career advice, cover letter, digital marketing, job hunt, Jobs, Marketing, Media, resume, Social Media, Work & Play, yec\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  if(window.pageChanged)\n    window.omni({\"channel\":\"business\",\"content_type\":\"article\",\"v_buy\":null,\"v_buy_i\":null,\"h_pub\":655.0,\"h_buy\":null,\"h_pub_buy\":null,\"v_cur\":1.6,\"v_max\":1.6,\"v_cur_i\":1,\"v_max_i\":1,\"events\":\"event51,event61\",\"top_channel\":\"business\",\"content_source_type\":\"Internal\",\"content_source_name\":\"Internal\",\"author_name\":\"Scott Gerber\",\"age\":\"27\",\"pub_day\":8,\"pub_month\":3,\"pub_year\":2016,\"pub_date\":\"03/08/2016\",\"sourced_from\":\"Internal\",\"isPostView\":true,\"post_lead_type\":\"Default\",\"topics\":\"Business,career advice,cover letter,digital marketing,job hunt,Jobs,Marketing,Media,resume,Social Media,Uncategorized,Work &amp;

Using a “best-in-show” mentality — that the biggest prize goes to the most fulfilling representation of its breed — there really is no contest in the Year of the Blockbuster.\nAs for the rest, well … I asked Mashable’s fellow film buffs to help weigh in, because frankly, though I saw more movies this year than any other, I couldn’t come up with 10 films from 2015 that I loved enough to grant year-end-best honors.\nThere were many titles that walked up to the line: The Revenant, Carol, Anomalisa, Creed and Ex Machina were all on the bubble, and I’d hoped my colleagues' enthusiasm might push them over the line. It didn’t. (They did, however, rescue The Martian and The Big Short, films I liked very much but didn’t love-love.)\nI’m not declaring 2015 a bad year for movies (I did that last year, and stand by it). It was just a lopsided one, a year in which the truly best films were also the biggest. Without a single major indie or “prestige” breakout at the box office, audiences clearly agreed.\nAll of that in mind, here's Mashable’s Top 10 for 2015:\nNo. 1: Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n\nDeeply, deeply conflicted about this movie, I am. \nIt's a remix of Star Wars: A New Hope, right down to its ships and vehicles, which puzzlingly have not evolved since their 1977 models. Neither have the costumes, the hairstyles, the weaponry, the MacGuffins, the major plot points or the presence of that one portly X-Wing pilot.\nDisney and Lucasfilm basically recreated your old bedroom for you but put some awesome new toys in it, and the strategy could not have been more effective. For all its glaring faults, The Force Awakens was breathless fun to watch and re-watch, it made us talk and feel and tweet and write endlessly, it will make $1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 at the box office — and it did so with two unknown actors in lead roles. \nWhat did you think was the best movie of 2015? If your answer was anything but Star Wars: The Force Awakens, try again. What other movie surrounds us, binds us, and brings us together? Said my colleague Adam Rosenberg: \"I saw someone say the tacit social media ban on Star Wars spoilers is the closest we got to world peace in 2015. They're not wrong.\"\nNo. 2: Spotlight\n\nThe biggest exception to the \"Year of Blockbusters\" is Spotlight, the presumptive front-runner for the Best Picture Oscar, and for good reason. \nNothing at all fancy here: Just a handful of our best actors digging into a great script. Lean, focused and exciting, this portrait of the Boston Globe's Pulitzer Prize-winning stories exposing systematic sexual abuse in the Catholic Church played more like a heist thriller. \nAnd it isn't just a Thing Journalists Like. Said my colleague Megan Hess: \"Beyond giving media folks a more modern movie reference than All The President's Men, this film showed the power of questioning things around you — which is, frankly, something we should all be doing more of.\"\nSEE ALSO: 'Spotlight' movie review: A thrilling dive into masterful journalism\nNo. 3: Inside Out\n\nIn terms of developing \"emotional intelligence,\" Inside Out was better than a year's worth of therapy sessions. \nPete Docter's vision of making emotions into characters was too daring, too out-there to be this clear in its purpose. And the payoff — that all the emotions are valuable, even the unpleasant ones — actually changed my life in a meaningful way. On some deep, resonant level, this was my No. 1 movie of 2015, and certainly one of my all-time favorites, period.\nSEE ALSO: 'Inside Out' review: You will walk out of the theater knowing yourself better \nNo. 4: Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nThe consensus No. 1 among critics and movie bloggers deserves its place there; in terms of pure auteurism, George Miller hits the gas and runs away with 2015's most compelling theater-going experience, period. \nThis budget-busting, deeply \"troubled\" retread of an aging franchise should have been a disaster. It wasn't. Instead, we got the freshest-looking hero/heroine flick of the decade. \nBumped down a few spots on my list for its thin \"drive away, drive back\" storyline, but that's not a knock. Said my colleague Kate Sommers-Dawes: \"That was a totally unexpected, shiny-and-chrome thrill. I laughed, I cried, I rejoiced at the feminist utopia suggested by the last scene. Also probably a preview of a Donald Trump presidency so ... start your water hoarding now.\"\nSEE ALSO: 'Mad Max: Fury Road' Review: Drive like hell to see this Maxterpiece\nNo. 5: Straight Outta Compton\n\nF. Gary Gray's film about the rise of N.W.A. was sharp, propulsive, brisk and brash — so much so that to hang \"biopic\" on this one seems ... off. \nStandout performances from O'Shea Jackson Jr., Jason Mitchell and Corey Hawkins earned this one a Screen Actors Guild nomination for ensemble, and it's criminal that none of these guys seems to be seriously contending for an Oscar. And at  $161 million in North America, audiences also thought that shit was doooooope.\nSEE ALSO: 'Straight Outta Compton' review: Hip-hop nostalgia goes Hollywood\nNo. 6: The Martian\n\nEverybody loves The Martian. I thought it was good, clean, forgettable fun — nothing about its themes stirred me — but it's more or less a unanimous choice among my colleagues and peers. So here it is.\nSEE ALSO: 'The Martian' review: Matt Damon, and the movie, are stellar\nNo. 7: Ant-Man\n\nMarvel showed another, funnier side with Ant-Man, establishing a new comic-relief character — and probably just in time, as a palate cleanser to the cool but often wearisome Avengers: Age of Ultron. Ant-Man works as a piece of the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe, but also makes for a fun, silly one-off, to the tune of half-a-billion dollars worldwide. \nSEE ALSO: 'Ant-Man' review: Earth's tiniest hero is also Marvel's funniest movie\nNo. 8: The Big Short\n\nAnother one voted in by my colleagues. I thoroughly enjoyed The Big Short and certainly learned something from it, but its ensemble of middle-aged white dudes, explanatory hurdles and hinky edits didn't scream \"Top 10\" to me. But definitely worth your time — and should have a second life in high-school economics classes as an annual watch when the teacher is out sick.\nSEE ALSO: 'The Big Short' review: The crippling housing crash never looked so ... funny\nNo. 9: Dope\n\nI loved this movie, despite it being about 30 minutes too long. Some called it \"John Hughes in the Hood,\" and I'm buying that distillation — the characters felt real, their predicaments felt real, the story felt real, and yet everything was utterly absurd and over the top. With clever nods to popular culture across at least three decades and a deeply satisfying payoff, Dope would've charted a lot higher in my personal Top 10.\nSEE ALSO: 'Dope' just blew up Sundance\nNo. 10: While We’re Young\n\nThe tension between Gen X and Millennials is real, it's widespread, and it's never been more accurately or hilariously depicted than in Noah Baumbach's While We're Young. I like Baumbach — he's quietly becoming our Woody Allen/Mike Nichols — but I was caught completely off-guard by how much I loved While We're Young, which skewers both generations pointedly but without bitterness. \nEveryone else loved these films — they just didn’t make the cut for me\nCarol: Strong contender for just about every Oscar there is, and deservedly so; it just left me slightly cold. Really nothing to criticize, except maybe the gratuitous puking scene.\nThe Revenant: Gorgeous, made with incredible skill, but only enjoyable as a one-off cinematic experience. I enjoyed every minute, and have no desire — nay, no need whatsoever — to ever see this again.\nAnomalisa: Charlie Kaufman's animated movie is a mini-marvel. The puppets are, in some ways, more human than humans; the interior of the hotel looks more like a hotel than a real-life hotel. The whole thing has something very striking to say about the frailty of human desire. This should probably be in the Top 10.\nEx Machina: A near-masterpiece that was undone by its jarring, oblique ending.\nCreed: We can all agree that Ryan Coogler is one of the best young directors in Hollywood and Creed was a bona fide hit, both critically and commercially. But boxing hasn't looked this cartoonish since ... well, the original Rocky films. There are at least 25 hits in this movie that would end any given match in real-life. I just can't let that pass.\nHateful Eight: Quentin Tarantino's apparent homage to John Carpenter's The Thing could've been the greatest 90 minutes in 2015. Instead, the distraction of road-show bells and whistles (70mm projection, overture, intermission), a few overly hammy performances and at least a full hour of fat made this one a slog to sit through.\nRoom: Easily my least favorite film of 2015. Exploitative, manipulative, cloying, suffocating. I nearly left the theater 20 minutes in, and now I wish I had. The confinement section was a dreary hell; the \"escape\" scene was clumsy and sloppily executed; the life-after-escape was draggy and hopeless. \nNot nearly as bad as advertised\nJupiter Ascending: The Wachowskis' gorgeous visuals and a unique take on our place in the galaxy were undermined by a few things, not the least of which is bad casting: Mila Kunis is a star, she's just not an intergalactic queen. And Channing Tatum's doggyness was plain silly.\nEntourage: Movie based on TV show turns out like that TV show, everyone gets mad? That makes no sense to me, and I'm no Entourage fan, but there was nothing worse about this movie than its source material.\nVacation: This movie made me laugh out loud at least 20 times, and the Tartan Prancer is my favorite comedic character of the year. \nBy the Sea: Angelina Jolie's attempt at an arthouse film is gorgeous and weird. Angelina Jolie is gorgeous and weird. That's just math.\nDefinitely as bad as advertised\nTomorrowland: Ugh.Terminator: Genisys: Ugh.Pixels: UGH.Fantastic Four: Oof.American Ultra: Seriously.\nSo bad that it gets its own category\nPan: \"So resoundingly awful that you have to see it.\"\n*Disclosure: I have yet to see these films, which fell on many critics' Top 10 lists: Brooklyn, Diary of a Teenage Girl, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, Sicario, Trumbo, Joy.\nHave something to say about this story?

         "Munich train stations reopened and trains were running on New Year's Day, but a warning about Islamic State extremists intending to blow themselves up in the German city remained in place.\n\"The information about an imminent terror attack at midnight was very concrete,\" police spokeswoman Elisabeth Matzinger told The Associated Press on Friday. \"Even though nothing happened, our terror warning stays in place.\"\nSee also: New Year's Eve security ramps up around the world\nJust shortly before the city rang in the new year, Munich police had evacuated the main train station and a station in the Pasing neighborhood. Partygoers were asked to avoid crowds.\n\nThe terror alert level in the southern German city of Munich remains high.Image: Sven Hoppe/picture-alliance/dpa/Associated PressAt a Friday news conference, Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said a friendly foreign intelligence service had warned Germany of an imminent attack at midnight by between five and seven Islamic State militants from Syria and Iraq planning to blow themselves up at locations in Munich, including the two stations.\nAuthorities were investigating intensively on Friday, Herrmann said, but so far had not made any arrests. He said they had received personal data for some of the attackers and were still in the process of investigating and verifying the information. He would not give any further details on the possible attackers.\nHerrmann called on Munich residents to be cautious, but at the same time not to let the warning interfere with their normal lives.\n\nMembers of the German police cordon off an entrance to the central railway station.Image: Sven Hoppe/picture-alliance/dpa/Associated PressMore than 500 police and special unit officers from all over the southern Bavaria region were called to Munich late Friday night to help evacuate and secure the stations. Friday noon, some 100 extra officers were still present in the city.\nHerrmann asked Munich residents for understanding that police would conduct more ID checks than usual.\nGerman Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere thanked all involved authorities for their \"thoughtful, considerate and decisive\" action in Munich on New Year's Eve.\n\"The situation in Europe and Germany continues to be serious in the new year,\" de Maiziere said. \"Indeed we did get indications (for a planned attack) yesterday, which were evaluated by the Bavarian intelligence authorities and federal police.\"\nDe Maiziere promised that in the future, German security officials would continue to analyze the situation thoroughly and act accordingly.\nDespite police warnings to stay away from big crowds, thousands of people were on the streets of Munich at midnight to welcome the new year with fireworks.\nCities across Europe have been on edge since an attack in Paris in November that killed 130 people.\nA few days after the Paris attack, a soccer stadium in Hannover in central Germany was evacuated after a threat against a friendly match between Germany and the Netherlands. The authorities never reported any findings of explosives or concrete attack plans.\n",

         "LOS ANGELES — Natalie Cole, the accomplished R&B and pop singer who won a Grammy for her 1991 album of duets with her late father, Nat \"King\" Cole, has died, Mashable has confirmed. She was 65.\nCole, who battled through health problems in recent years, died of complications from ongoing health issues. She passed away late Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to a family statement.\n\"Unforgettable ... With Love\" won six Grammy Awards, including album of the year, record and song. Nat \"King\" Cole had died some 25 years earlier, of lung cancer, when Natalie was just 15.\n\n\"Natalie fought a fierce, courageous battle, dying how she lived ... with dignity, strength and honor. Our beloved Mother and sister will be greatly missed and remain UNFORGETTABLE in our hearts forever,\" read the statement from her son Robert Yancy and sisters Timolin and Casey Cole.\nCole caught the music bug from her father, and auditioned to sing with him when she was 11. Cole's early success came in the mid-1970s with R&B hits like \"This Will Be,\" \"Inseparable\" and \"Our Love.\" The music industry welcomed her with two Grammy awards in 1976 — one for best new artist and one for best female R&B vocal performance for her buoyant hit \"This Will Be.\"\nBut she re-emerged in the '90s as more of a pop and smooth-jazz artist like her father, finding her biggest success with the duets record, which sold 14 million copies.\nShe also worked as an actress, with appearances on TV's Touched by an Angel and Grey's Anatomy. But she was happiest touring and performing live.\n\"I still love recording and still love the stage,\" she said on her website in 2008, \"but like my dad, I have the most fun when I am in front of that glorious orchestra or that kick-butt big band.\"\n\nShe became an anti-drug advocate later in life after battling addiction to heroin and cocaine early in her career, entering rehab in 1983. Complications for hepatitis C forced her to undergo a kidney transplant in 2009.\nThe organ procurement agency One Legacy facilitated the donation from a family that had requested that their donor's organ go to Cole if it was a match.\nCole toured through much of her illness, often receiving dialysis at hospitals around the globe.\n\"I think that I am a walking testimony to you can have scars,\" she told People magazine. \"You can go through turbulent times and still have victory in your life.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting to this story.\n\n\n\nTopics:\nEntertainment, Music, Natalie Cole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  if(window.pageChanged)\n    window.omni({\"channel\":\"entertainment\",\"content_type\":\"article\",\"v_buy\":null,\"v_buy_i\":null,\"h_pub\":2279.0,\"h_buy\":null,\"h_pub_buy\":null,\"v_cur\":1.1,\"v_max\":2.0,\"v_cur_i\":1,\"v_max_i\":2,\"events\":\"event51,event61\",\"top_channel\":\"entertainment\",\"content_source_type\":\"Internal\",\"content_source_name\":\"Internal\",\"author_name\":\"Josh Dickey\",\"age\":\"94\",\"pub_day\":1,\"pub_month\":1,\"pub_year\":2016,\"pub_date\":\"01/01/2016\",\"sourced_from\":\"Internal\",\"isPostView\":true,\"post_lead_type\":\"Default\",\"topics\":\"Entertainment,Music,Natalie Cole,Uncategorized\",\"campaign\":null,\"display_mode\":null,\"viral_video_type\":null,\"b_flag\":true});\n    metaData = {\"link\":[[\"canonical\",\"http://mashable.com/2016/01/01/natalie-cole-death/\"],[\"image_src\",\"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzAxLzAxL2MxL25hdGFsaWUuY29sLjAyZGE0LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4NjI3IwplCWpwZw/46e4cc40/55a/natalie.cole_.jpg\"]],\"meta_property\":[[\"og:url\",\"http://mashable.com/2016/01/01/natalie-cole-death/\"],[\"og:title\",\"Natalie Cole, 'Unforgettable' Grammy-winning singer, has died\"],[\"og:type\",\"article\"],[\"og:site_name\",\"Mashable\"],[\"og:description\",\"Natalie Cole, the accomplished R&B and pop singer who won a Grammy for her 1991 album of duets with her late father, Nat \\\"King\\\" Cole, has died, Mashable has confirmed.

         "Camille Cosby will likely have to testify in a defamation suit against her husband, the famed comedian Bill Cosby, who is accused of sexually assaulting dozens of women over several decades. \nA Massachusetts judge denied Camille's motion on Dec. 31 to sidestep testifying against her husband in a case brought against him by seven women. The women say the comedian sexually assaulted them and then called them liars when they went public with their accusations. \nSee also: Why a Bill Cosby accuser is getting a second chance at a trial 12 years later\nCamille is scheduled to appear in court on Jan. 6, though her lawyers are likely to appeal the decision. \nHer lawyers challenged the initial deposition by saying that Camille's conversations with her husband are private and not to be aired in court. \nBut Camille also worked as her husband's business manager, a much more public aspect of their relationship. \nThe privacy of spousal conversations is generally protected by law. And while Massachusetts Judge David Hennessy said that those privacy concerns are important, in this case, he said they \"do not outweigh the potential significance of Mrs. Cosby's testimony\" due to Camille's \"dual role as defendants' wife and business manager.\"\nThe judge's decision in Massachusetts is the second significant legal blow to the Cosbys this week. \nBill Cosby was charged with aggravated indecent assault in a separate case in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. He is accused of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, who used to work at Temple University, back in 2004. \nHe was released on $1 million bail. If convicted, Cosby faces up to a decade behind bars. \n",

         "Though in the final year of his presidency, President Barack Obama is continuing to break personal ground by visiting a U.S. mosque for the first time in his presidency. \nObama plans to visit the Islamic Society of Baltimore on Wednesday to meet with leaders of the local Muslim community. \nSee also: Obama just gave his best immigration speech — and you probably missed it\nThe visit will amount to a public embrace of Muslims by Obama at a time when political discourse against them seems to be growing in some quarters, largely fueled by fears of terrorist acts carried out by extremist groups. The White House said he will go to the Baltimore mosque to \"celebrate the contributions Muslim Americans make to our nation and reaffirm the importance of religious freedom to our way of life.\"\nIn remarks to be delivered at the mosque, Obama \"will reiterate the importance of staying true to our core values: welcoming our fellow Americans, speaking out against bigotry, rejecting indifference and protecting our nation's tradition of religious freedom,\" the White House said.\n\noverwhelming majority of americans understand of diversity and religious pluralism is one of our greatest strengths https://t.co/AM1JLoA1TI\n— President Obama (@POTUS) January 14, 2016\n\n\nso we all need to speak out against bias and stereotypes, to protect the freedom of others, and our own as well.\n— President Obama (@POTUS) January 14, 2016\n\nObama has been outspoken in pushing back against calls by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and others to block Muslims from being admitted to the U.S. over fears of domestic terrorism linked to radical extremist groups.\nOthers have cited potential security risks in pushing legislation in Congress to limit the resettlement of refugees from Iraq and Syria, where the Islamic State group is active and from which it has exported its brand of terrorism to other regions of the world.\nIt was a topic Obama addressed in his final State of the Union address a few weeks ago, saying:\nThat’s why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn’t a matter of political correctness. It’s a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith. His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that “to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.” When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn’t make us safer. That’s not telling it like it is. It’s just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country.\n\n\n\n\"That’s not telling it like it is.\"http://on.mash.to/1SNJfE8\nPosted by Mashable News on Tuesday, January 12, 2016\n\nObama has argued that such efforts are wrong and serve only to incite extremist groups, weaken America's leadership around the world and put U.S. security at risk.\n\"We're not going to build progress with a bunch of phony tough talk, and bluster, and over-the-top claims that just play into ISIL's hands,\" the president said, using an acronym for the Islamic State. He spoke to House Democrats on Thursday as they strategized at a meeting in Baltimore. \"We're not going to strengthen our leadership around the world by allowing politicians to insult Muslims or pit groups of Americans against each other. That's not who we are. That's not keeping America safe.\"\nObama himself has battled various conservative conspiracy theories that he himself is a Muslim (he is not), a storyline that has reared its head even in this election cycle. \nAdditional reporting by Mashable.

         "The Internet can often be a cold, dark place. But there are instances when a story strikes such a chord with online audiences that a community can coalesce around a subject for the greater good. \nRetiring Marietta, Ohio police officer Matthew Hickey and his K9 partner, Ajax, are discovering how wonderful that can be. \nSee also: Over 100 police dogs walk in procession to honor fallen comrade\nAs Hickey planned to retire, he had assumed that Ajax would come to live with him. Ajax has lived with Hickey for the last three years and the retired officer considers the dog \"a family member\" in addition to the dog's role on the police force.  \n“There is a bond between us and it’s very special and I would hate to lose my buddy,” Hickey told WTAP.\nBut there's a catch: according to city law, Ajax is property of the city of Marietta. And Ohio state law says, \"A law enforcement officer who leaves an equine or canine unit of a law enforcement agency while the police dog or horse assigned to the officer is still fit for duty forfeits the right to purchase the animal under this section.\"\nHickey found out when his chief rejected his offer to purchase Ajax, telling WTAP, “I had the money for the dog and was ready to hand it to the the chief of police, and the chief of police said he couldn’t take it.\"\n\nSad story about how a Marietta K9 Officer could loose his beloved partner Ajax. SAT0157 pic.twitter.com/qFcu614SuS\n— CBS Newspath (@cbsnewspath) January 31, 2016\n\nAjax is six years old and considered fit for active duty for several more years. Even though Hickey offered to pay the city to keep the dog — the city says Ajax is worth $3,500 — city law dictates that the dog must be sold at auction, though the auction is limited to only active and retired police and any officially sanctioned K9 trainers. \nMarietta Law Director Paul Betram III told WBNS, “The dog is property of the city of Marietta. Because it is personal property, it is treated like a shovel. That's just the way it is.”\nAnd that's where the Internet stepped in. A Change.org petition collected over 22,000 signatures and Facebook users took to the city of Marietta's page to express their displeasure with the law. \n\n(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\nYour voices are being heard and your comments are important. All posts that have been received have been passed on;...\nPosted by Marietta Ohio on Friday, January 29, 2016\n\nBut then the collective of supporters decided to channel their rage more productively. Rather than let Hickey have to sweat out the possibility of being outbid, a GoFundMe page has raised over $50,000 in less than a week to go towards Hickey's purchase of Ajax at auction. The auction date has yet to be set, but should be announced on Thursday, February 4th. \n\nAssuming no one tries to outbid Hickey for Ajax (and, really, who would be so cold?), the remaining money is to be spent on protective vests for K9 units, a growing trend in light of recent law enforcement incidents. \nA GoFundMe campaign recently raised more than $37,000 for police dog vests in Canton, Ohio following the recent death of K9 Jethro who was killed in the line of duty on January 9. And CNN's Anderson Cooper made a similar gesture following the death of another K9 in Virginia. \nThe vests will probably continue to be an ongoing topic following Sunday's stabbing death of a K9 officer in the line of duty near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \n",

         "As the battle between Apple and the FBI heats up over encryption, it's increasingly clear this isn't just about one iPhone.\nA New York Times article on Saturday reported that the Department of Justice is worried about the encryption on apps such as WhatsApp.\nSee also: Apple calls DOJ's most recent response to San Bernardino case 'a cheap shot'\nAccording to The Times, the encryption built into WhatsApp has stymied Justice Department attempts at wiretapping. Even with a judge's wiretap order, WhatsApp's encryption prevents law enforcement from reading or intercepting messages sent on its platform.\nThis is a problem for the Department of Justice, and it's one without a clear solution. A court could order WhatsApp — which is owned by Facebook — to comply with wiretap orders, but it would face technical and legal challenges. \nThe problem, at least for the Justice Department, may only be getting tougher.\nThe Guardian reported on Monday that Facebook, Google and Snapchat are all working to increase their own encryption and privacy in the wake of the Apple vs. FBI showdown.\nAccording to The Guardian, WhatsApp plans on adding encryption to its voice calls in a few weeks. The Guardian says Facebook is also looking at increasing the encryption used for Facebook Messenger.\nSnapchat is reportedly also at creating more secure messages, though let's be clear: Snapchat hardly has the best track record with securing user data. Google too is said to be looking at ways use its encryption technology in more places.\nTech companies getting serious about encryption\nLast week, Medium's Steven Levy wrote an extraordinary piece chronicling the Crypto Wars from the '90s. Two decades ago, law enforcement and technologists battled over the ideas of encryption.\nFor a time, it looked like cryptography won, with the Clinton administration basically accepting that for the digital revolution to happen, it would have to happen with crypto.\nStandards such as AES-128 (and, later, AES-256), SSL and public keys became part of the tech lexicon and the modern computer security industry was born.\nStill, as Levy writes, winning the war doesn't mean everything has been great for consumers (emphasis added):\nBut here's something that didn't happen: a strong crypto infrastructure that protected our information and privacy. The fact is that while the security industry has boomed, our information really isn't much safer than it was when we were fighting the first crypto war. This is because the tech world has been slow to build strong encryption into our systems as a default. It's been too hard to use, and all too often businesses and institutions don't even take obvious steps to secure data. Chronic lapses in our communications software and disasters happen on almost a daily basis. ...We simply haven't used our capabilities to make our electrical grids, our credit card systems, and our ISPs bulletproof. As a result, the public has not fully reaped the spoils from winning that first crypto war. \nBut slowly but surely, that has been changing. Maybe it's the public realization that so much of our data is now stored on the cloud. Or perhaps it's the increase in hacks that leave private information vulnerable.\nWhatever the reason, even before the most recent Apple vs. FBI nonsense, we've seen tech companies start to get more serious about building better encryption into their products.\nIf companies want consumers to trust them with their data, they increasingly have to prove that they are capable of protecting that data. And that's possible with encryption.\nWhich of course, is the big rub for law enforcement.\nTwo decades ago, the government agreed that the promises of the Clipper Chip — a chip that was designed to protect communications except if there was a government request for access — were simply infeasible (the Clipper Chip project was dropped in 1996 after its encryption technology was hacked). Today, it does seem that we're having similar conversations, although the stakes are different.\nOn the most recent episode of the HBO show Last Week Tonight, John Oliver does an admirable job dissecting the latest conversation about encryption. It's worth watching.\n \nWhat's next\nIf Google, Facebook, Snapachat, Apple and other companies do continue to add better encryption to their platforms by default — and it seems like that is absolutely going to happen — we're going to have to have a much broader discussion in Congress about encryption and its role.\nThere aren't easy answers, and in a perfect world there could be concessions both sides make that balance the underlying challenges of personal information security versus homeland security.\nBut for now, it will be interesting to see how law enforcement handles the reality that the tools we use to communicate are going to be more and more difficult to intercept.\n",

         "If you're still painstakingly killing all your apps in the hopes of squeezing out some extra battery life from your iPhone, you can officially stop.\nApple's iOS chief Craig Federighi has dispelled the myth that force closing your iPhone apps will help save your battery. The executive confirmed that killing apps isn't necessary for your battery and said that he is not in the habit of closing his apps.\nSee also: How to use Low Power Mode on the iPhone to save battery life\nFederighi, who oversees iOS and OS X, was responding to an email sent by an Apple customer to CEO Tim Cook when he made the comments. In the email, which was first published by 9to5Mac, the customer asked Cook, \"do you quit your iOS multitasking apps frequently and is this necessary of battery life?\"\nThough the note, dated March 6, was sent to Cook, Federighi weighed in the next day with a simple answer. \"No and no,\" he wrote. (You can see the full email exchange here.)\nThis is far from the first time this particular myth has been debunked. Apple's own support page even states that \"generally, there's no need to force an app to close unless it's unresponsive.\"\nThat's because, as 9to5Mac and others have pointed out, most of the apps that appear in the multitasking view when you double press the home button aren't actually running in the background. From Apple:\nAfter you switch to a different app, some apps run for a short period of time before they're set to a suspended state. Apps that are in a suspended state aren’t actively in use, open, or taking up system resources\nOf course, it's always a good idea to check your app settings every once in awhile to make sure that the apps that are using your location actually need it — as location services tend to use up the most battery. Also,  disabling background refresh on apps you don't use very much is a good idea. Some apps, like Facebook's, may be worse offenders at sucking your battery dry than others.\n",

         "Is Just Cause 3 a cry for help?\nThere's a mission during the game's third act that so closely resembles an earlier pair from the first two acts that the back-and-forth dialogue lapses into a sort of self-aware fatigue.\nSee also: 'Futurama' will live on — as a mobile game, at least\nTo paraphrase: \"Oh, we're doing this again.\" \"Yup. Follow the trail of pipes and shoot all the things, then blow up the three big things and escape. You've done this before, you're good.\" \"Gotcha.\"\nNothing exists in a video game without its creators consciously putting it there. People built this series of three missions, saw how mindlessly similar they were and wrote a script calling that out. It's like the team at Avalanche Studios knew their game had issues, and is surreptitiously apologizing.\n\nImage: Avalanche StudiosIt's not a total loss. Just Cause 3 gives good sandbox. Great sandbox, even. The simple act of running and jumping and grappling and parachuting and wingsuiting and blowing stuff up and— okay, it's not simple. The learning curve ascends to great heights very quickly.\nExpect to spend several hours faceplanting into cliffs, rocky outcroppings and completely flat surfaces before you get the hang of transitioning between your three main movement tools: the grapple, the parachute and the wingsuit. There's a lot of frustration as you grow accustomed to the feel of things, but it's a mountain worth climbing for fans of chaos.\n\"Chaos\" is the point system that rules the game, a meaningless score that measures the destruction you've sown across the many islands making up the fictional Republic of Medici. The higher your score, the more stuff you've destroyed.\nJust Cause 3 is riddled with numerical ladder climbs like this, though the more meaningful ones measure your progress against your friends and a global leaderboard. As you fly around in a wingsuit, or score consecutive headshots, or perform any number of other invisibly tracked actions, miniature pop-ups show you how you rank alongside other players.\n\"What's that, game? If I fly around for another 30 seconds without touching the ground, I'll beat my friend's score? Maybe I won't start this mission just yet....\"\nIn a game that too often struggles to find its voice, climbing numerical ladders in an endless quest to one-up your friends is a major motivator. Moving and shooting is a lot of fun once you get the hang of it, but leaderboards give purpose to your mayhem.\n\nImage: Avalanche StudiosThe problems spring up when you dive into anything more structured.\nTake the story. It's incomprehensible. Character introductions seem to assume that players know who these people are from past games. That familiarity is unearned, making it hard to follow what's going on beyond the basic \"evil dictator = bad guy\" conceit.\nThere's also not much reason to figure things out. At best, story missions are rote exercises that do very little to make the core gameplay more interesting than it often is when you're causing trouble in the open world. More often than not, you're defending something or fighting off waves of attackers. Each story act concludes with a lengthy traipse through smaller battles, in which the goal is literally: kill all the red blips.\nSeparate from the story are Challenges, a collection of minigames that test your skills in a variety of disciplines. One asks you to fly your wingsuit through a series of rings. In another, you have to keep an explosives-packed vehicle above a certain speed as you steer it into a distant group of enemies.\nDo well in these Challenges and you earn \"Gears,\" which unlock upgrades. There's just one problem: None of the minigames evolve enough over time to make climbing the upgrade tree an enjoyable process. The islands of Medici are visually rich with different terrains, but the beauty of it all never hides the fact that you're performing the same task on repeat.\nThe dullness that pervades both the story and the upgrade process falls into the background once you get the hang of exploration and sowing destruction. Just Cause 3 turns into a different game as you venture out into the world and reclaim territory from the Bad Guy Evil Dictator with no real direction save for the one you set yourself.\nThis can result in some weird inconsistencies on the story side, such as when you have to infiltrate a base or town that your rebel forces already control. But who cares? Blowing stuff up in creative ways is the best Just Cause 3 has to offer.\nIt's truly thrilling to fly across the world using nothing more than a grappling hook, a parachute and a wingsuit, only to then land, plant some C4 (from your infinite supply) and grapple away as everything explodes behind you.\n\nImage: Avalanche StudiosThose skyscraping highs turn Just Cause 3 into its own worst enemy. There's nothing in the game that compares to the absolute freedom of exploring and destroying its wide open world. As great as those moments are, there's not enough video game here to support them.\nSo I ask again: Is Just Cause 3 a cry for help? Is it an object lesson in the creative well running dry? Or is there more that happened behind the scenes to explain how this weird mix of mechanical perfection and design disaster came to exist?\n\nJust Cause 3\n\n\nThe Good\nMassive, environmentally varied open world • Wingsuit injects fresh thrills into a series lauded for its movement • Creative destruction is a lot of fun\nThe Bad\nThe story feels disjointed • Challenges turn the upgrade grind into an unpleasant chore\nThe Bottom Line\nJust Cause 3 nails the basics, but fails to build a competent video game around that foundation. \n\n\n",

         "Since the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, hotels in the city have seen occupancy rates drop as much as 30%. Flight reservations are down 27%.\nA government estimate of the damage to France's economy tops $2 billion.\nWith images of the attacks and a militarized response circulating the globe, the sharp drops are not surprising — but Paris depends on tourists. And the appearance of turmoil following the deadly attacks can continue to do economic damage, even as the city returns to normalcy.\nThe tourism industry employs some 260,000 people in the city, or 20% of the full-time workforce: Visitors spent $17 billion in Paris in 2014. In all of France, tourism represents nearly 10% of GDP, supporting almost 3 million jobs. Which is why, amid mourning and the political response to the threat of the Islamic State, tourism industry leaders met with French Prime Minister Manual Valls last week to discuss how to approach the holiday season.\nGovernment officials, the hotel industry, airlines, restaurants, shops and tour agents all face the same challenge of convincing the world that France is still the top international destination. Fortunately for the city, there are already some indicators that the tourism industry is getting back on track.\nThere have been some positive signs for the industry amid the tragedy: Gavin Tollman, CEO of Trafalgar Tours, told Mashable that a near majority of the tour agency's customers did not cancel booked trips in response to the attacks.\n\"Those who had made their decisions (to travel to France) maintained them,\" he said. \"But what we did see was the impact on future bookings.\"\nLooking ahead\nLarge companies have some flexibility to ride out the downturn.\n“Parisian hoteliers should be reaching out to guests, rethinking their strategy in source markets, looking at new demand opportunities and saying that the city is not defined by this one act,” said Elizabeth Winkle, managing director of STR Global, in Hotel News Now.\nFor small companies, however, a bad season can do a lot of damage: Prodiss, the union for French show producers, reported an 80% drop in ticket sales compared to the same period last year.\nFor hotels, the drop in interest could save undeterred travelers some money. There are plenty of deals to be found for December and January travel dates.\n\nImage: ExpediaThe same can be seen for airfares, though the cuts have not been as across the board.\n\nParis pic.twitter.com/ethNrNFzUL\n— Air France (@airfrance) November 17, 2015\n\nTravel-information company Forward Data SL said bookings to Paris over the Christmas holiday were down 13% compared with last year since the Nov. 13 attacks.\nForward Data CEO Olivier Jager said in an interview that the company reviewed bookings data that it buys from ticket information distribution systems used by 200,000 travel agencies. The information does not include trips booked directly with the airlines, which is roughly half of all tickets.\nAirfare data company Hopper saw a spike in searches for U.S.-to-Paris flights right after the attacks, followed by a drop that puts interest significantly lower than last year.\n\nImage: Hopper\"I suspect the initial spike is due to many people with future Paris travel plans checking on their options to change/cancel,\" Hopper's Chief Data Scientist Patrick Surry said, \"and then demand tapered off as fewer people look to plan future travel there.\"\nAs for airfare, prices have mostly held steady both for trips originating in the U.S. and in Paris, according to Hopper's data.\n\nImage: Hopper'Europe is open'\n\"I've heard it countless times, if we give in to terrorism, and change our lives, we are actually allowing them to win,\" said Tollman, CEO of Trafalgar.\nAlthough he considers the attacks \"transformational\" for international travel, he's hopeful that giving people the facts will return tourism to normal levels.\n\"It's important that the world sees that Europe is open,\" he said.\n\nThe best night market in Paris!!pic.twitter.com/bnzpAJGrsg\n— falconlover (@shinigamifoc) November 29, 2015\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report\n      window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement('script');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);};\n_msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\");\n\n\n\nTopics:\ndestinations, Paris, Travel, Travel & Leisure, World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  if(window.pageChanged)\n    window.omni({\"channel\":\"world\",\"content_type\":\"article\",\"v_buy\":null,\"v_buy_i\":null,\"h_pub\":3017.5,\"h_buy\":null,\"h_pub_buy\":null,\"v_cur\":0.1,\"v_max\":0.1,\"v_cur_i\":0,\"v_max_i\":0,\"events\":\"event51,event61\",\"top_channel\":\"world\",\"content_source_type\":\"Internal\",\"content_source_name\":\"Internal\",\"author_name\":\"Jessica Plautz\",\"age\":\"125\",\"pub_day\":1,\"pub_month\":12,\"pub_year\":2015,\"pub_date\":\"12/01/2015\",\"sourced_from\":\"Internal\",\"isPostView\":true,\"post_lead_type\":\"Default\",\"topics\":\"destinations,Paris,Travel,Travel & Leisure,Uncategorized,World\",\"campaign\":null,\"display_mode\":null,\"viral_video_type\":null,\"b_flag\":true});\n    metaData = {\"link\":[[\"canonical\",\"http://mashable.com/2015/11/30/paris-holiday/\"],[\"image_src\",\"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzAxLzI2L3BhcmlzNi43YzVlOC5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxMjAweDYyNyMKZQlqcGc/a2415699/102/paris6.jpg\"]],\"meta_property\":[[\"og:url\",\"http://mashable.com/2015/11/30/paris-holiday/\"],[\"og:title\",\"France is hoping to salvage tourism for the holiday season\"],[\"og:type\",\"article\"],[\"og:site_name\",\"Mashable\"],[\"og:description\",\"Hotel occupancy rates are down 30%.

         "Although Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has so far struck a conciliatory tone at the U.N. Climate Summit in Paris, known as COP21, he broke with other world leaders Tuesday by refusing to sign a pledge phasing out fossil fuel subsidies.\nUnder former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who once declared coal is \"good for humanity,\" Australia walked back many of its climate change commitments, including abandoning a carbon trading scheme. \nTurnbull, who addressed COP21 on Monday local time, has reemphasised the country's appetite for combatting global warming, but environmental advocates are watching Australia's new prime minister closely as he attends the landmark talks in Paris.\nSee also: Latest updates: Paris climate talks\nThe COP21 communiqué aimed to eliminate inefficient subsidies for coal, gas and oil that keep prices artificially low.\nThe rejection of the fossil fuel pledge came after politicians from Australia's Nationals party, who tend to represent rural areas, lobbied against it, ABC News reported.\nThey were particularly concerned about the effect the pledge might have on the diesel fuel rebate for farmers and miners. In an ABC interview Tuesday, Nationals deputy leader Barnaby Joyce said signing the statement would cause Australia to lose a significant amount of its agricultural export income. \"It would make sections of the agricultural industry unviable,\" he said. It's unclear if the pledge would have impacted the diesel fuel rebate.\nOn the ABC Tuesday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop pointed out that at the G20 in 2009, Australia also signed a pledge to phase out \"inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption.\"\nIn his COP21 address, Turnbull said Australia would ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. He also pledged that the government would contribute at least A$1 billion (US$723 million) out of the aid budget over the next five years to build climate resilience among Pacific nations. \"Australia is not daunted by the challenge. With great optimism and faith in humanity’s genius for invention,\" he said.\nAustralia has also joined the U.S. and other countries in committing to double its clean energy investment as part of a new initiative, Mission Innovation.\nThe Australian government's current emissions reduction target is 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2030.\nOpposition leader Bill Shorten, whose Labor Party has a policy of a 45% reduction in pollution by 2030, told reporters Tuesday that despite Turnbull's rhetoric, he is still following the ineffective climate policies laid down by Abbott. \"We don't see Australia taking climate change as seriously as other countries,\" he said.\n",

         "Since the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, hotels in the city have seen occupancy rates drop as much as 30%. Flight reservations are down 27%.\nA government estimate of the damage to France's economy tops $2 billion.\nWith images of the attacks and a militarized response circulating the globe, the sharp drops are not surprising — but Paris depends on tourists. And the appearance of turmoil following the deadly attacks can continue to do economic damage, even as the city returns to normalcy.\nThe tourism industry employs some 260,000 people in the city, or 20% of the full-time workforce: Visitors spent $17 billion in Paris in 2014. In all of France, tourism represents nearly 10% of GDP, supporting almost 3 million jobs. Which is why, amid mourning and the political response to the threat of the Islamic State, tourism industry leaders met with French Prime Minister Manual Valls last week to discuss how to approach the holiday season.\nGovernment officials, the hotel industry, airlines, restaurants, shops and tour agents all face the same challenge of convincing the world that France is still the top international destination. Fortunately for the city, there are already some indicators that the tourism industry is getting back on track.\nThere have been some positive signs for the industry amid the tragedy: Gavin Tollman, CEO of Trafalgar Tours, told Mashable that a near majority of the tour agency's customers did not cancel booked trips in response to the attacks.\n\"Those who had made their decisions (to travel to France) maintained them,\" he said. \"But what we did see was the impact on future bookings.\"\nLooking ahead\nLarge companies have some flexibility to ride out the downturn.\n“Parisian hoteliers should be reaching out to guests, rethinking their strategy in source markets, looking at new demand opportunities and saying that the city is not defined by this one act,” said Elizabeth Winkle, managing director of STR Global, in Hotel News Now.\nFor small companies, however, a bad season can do a lot of damage: Prodiss, the union for French show producers, reported an 80% drop in ticket sales compared to the same period last year.\nFor hotels, the drop in interest could save undeterred travelers some money. There are plenty of deals to be found for December and January travel dates.\n\nImage: ExpediaThe same can be seen for airfares, though the cuts have not been as across the board.\n\nParis pic.twitter.com/ethNrNFzUL\n— Air France (@airfrance) November 17, 2015\n\nTravel-information company Forward Data SL said bookings to Paris over the Christmas holiday were down 13% compared with last year since the Nov. 13 attacks.\nForward Data CEO Olivier Jager said in an interview that the company reviewed bookings data that it buys from ticket information distribution systems used by 200,000 travel agencies. The information does not include trips booked directly with the airlines, which is roughly half of all tickets.\nAirfare data company Hopper saw a spike in searches for U.S.-to-Paris flights right after the attacks, followed by a drop that puts interest significantly lower than last year.\n\nImage: Hopper\"I suspect the initial spike is due to many people with future Paris travel plans checking on their options to change/cancel,\" Hopper's Chief Data Scientist Patrick Surry said, \"and then demand tapered off as fewer people look to plan future travel there.\"\nAs for airfare, prices have mostly held steady both for trips originating in the U.S. and in Paris, according to Hopper's data.\n\nImage: Hopper'Europe is open'\n\"I've heard it countless times, if we give in to terrorism, and change our lives, we are actually allowing them to win,\" said Tollman, CEO of Trafalgar.\nAlthough he considers the attacks \"transformational\" for international travel, he's hopeful that giving people the facts will return tourism to normal levels.\n\"It's important that the world sees that Europe is open,\" he said.\n\nThe best night market in Paris!!pic.twitter.com/bnzpAJGrsg\n— falconlover (@shinigamifoc) November 29, 2015\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report\n      window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement('script');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);};\n_msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\");\n\n\n\nTopics:\ndestinations, Paris, Travel, Travel & Leisure, World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  if(window.pageChanged)\n    window.omni({\"channel\":\"world\",\"content_type\":\"article\",\"v_buy\":null,\"v_buy_i\":null,\"h_pub\":3017.5,\"h_buy\":null,\"h_pub_buy\":null,\"v_cur\":0.1,\"v_max\":0.1,\"v_cur_i\":0,\"v_max_i\":0,\"events\":\"event51,event61\",\"top_channel\":\"world\",\"content_source_type\":\"Internal\",\"content_source_name\":\"Internal\",\"author_name\":\"Jessica Plautz\",\"age\":\"125\",\"pub_day\":1,\"pub_month\":12,\"pub_year\":2015,\"pub_date\":\"12/01/2015\",\"sourced_from\":\"Internal\",\"isPostView\":true,\"post_lead_type\":\"Default\",\"topics\":\"destinations,Paris,Travel,Travel & Leisure,Uncategorized,World\",\"campaign\":null,\"display_mode\":null,\"viral_video_type\":null,\"b_flag\":true});\n    metaData = {\"link\":[[\"canonical\",\"http://mashable.com/2015/11/30/paris-holiday/\"],[\"image_src\",\"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzAxLzI2L3BhcmlzNi43YzVlOC5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxMjAweDYyNyMKZQlqcGc/a2415699/102/paris6.jpg\"]],\"meta_property\":[[\"og:url\",\"http://mashable.com/2015/11/30/paris-holiday/\"],[\"og:title\",\"France is hoping to salvage tourism for the holiday season\"],[\"og:type\",\"article\"],[\"og:site_name\",\"Mashable\"],[\"og:description\",\"Hotel occupancy rates are down 30%.

         "SEOUL, South Korea — Samsung appointed a new mobile president at Samsung Electronics for the first time in six years after growth stalled at the world's largest smartphone maker.\nThe Samsung Group conglomerate said Tuesday that Dongjin Koh was promoted to president. He will replace Shin Jong-kyun as the head of the mobile business at its flagship company Samsung Electronics starting next year. The change was announced as part of annual management reshuffle at South Korea's top conglomerate.\nSee also: Samsung surprises, but its Galaxy is still shrinking\nSamsung Electronics' smartphone sales lead has been dwindling in the face of competition from Apple Inc. in the premium market and Chinese companies in cheaper devices. The management change comes as Lee Jae-yong, the only son of ailing Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, takes a bigger role in Samsung after his father suffered a heart attack in May last year.\nShin will step away from day-to-day operations and focus on long-term strategies. He keeps his title of CEO of the IT and mobile division that encompasses phone, network and computer businesses.\nKoh, an engineer, was an executive vice president who led mobile research and development for the past year.\nThe 54-year-old has followed the typical career path of those who reach senior executive levels in South Korea: he joined Samsung Electronics in 1984 and over three decades worked his way through its development, human resources, product planning and research departments.\nSamsung said he led the development of two flagship smartphones released this year, the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5. He was also behind development of the Samsung Pay mobile payments system.\nShin became the head of mobile in 2010. Three years later, Samsung was the world largest smartphone supplier despite being a latecomer behind Apple.\nBut in the past year, Samsung's global smartphone market share has dwindled to less than one quarter and its quarterly mobile profit shrank to less than half of its best quarters.\n",

         "The 7-Eleven convenience store chain may have started in the U.S. but its international presence serves a variety of cultural tastes and traditions. What the store offers depends less on its moniker and much more on its location. \nWhen Joe Thompson opened the first outlet of what would become 7-Eleven in Dallas, Texas in 1927, it operated out of Southland Ice Company's ice dock and sold milk, eggs and bread. The goal was to let customers quickly and easily get these daily items without having to go through the hassle of getting to or navigating a traditional grocery store. \nThe idea worked and more locations opened. \nThe stores became known as \"Tote'm Stores,\" because customers toted away purchases. The name was changed to 7-Eleven in 1946 to reflect the company's new seven a.m. to 11 p.m. schedule. \nSee also: China's street food vendors are creating edible works of art\n\nA 1950s era 7-Eleven.Image: Flickr, Roadside PicturesAt the time, these late hours were unheard of and put 7-Eleven on the map. \nNow there are 56,600 franchises worldwide, making 7-Eleven the world's largest convenience store chain. The chain made its Asian debut in Taiwan in 1979 and from there expanded to many Asian countries over the next three decades and counting.\nThe brand may be global, but its services and products vastly differ according to locale. \nIn the U.S., it's still a place to pick up essentials and snacks — it's convenient and inexpensive. Customers pop in for tissues, a six-pack of beer and maybe a bag of potato chips. Some 7-Elevens have attached gas stations, and act as unofficial rest stops on road trips. \n\n\nA photo posted by aziz x (@azizxthegod) on Nov 23, 2015 at 9:34am PST\n\nIt's certainly not typically seen as a dining destination — at least not by Americans. \nBy contrast, many convenience stores in Asia have little in common with their American counterparts. They are places to socialize, to spend time in, and are bonafide foodie destinations in their own right. \n\nIn, Taiwan, many 7-Elevens offer dry cleaning. In Indonesia, some are  cool hangouts where people spend hours sipping coffee and chatting with friends. \nWhy many Asian countries have embraced the full-service convenience store, the model is constantly evolving. One theory says these stores have, through modest pricing and an array of services and goods made themselves meeting points that reinforce community interaction. Another says the inviting environments, with outdoor seating and Internet connections, offer an oasis for millennials in crowded cities where space is at a premium. \nFood host and actor Lynn Chen tells Mashable 7-Elevens in Taiwan are \"more like community hubs where people hang out, do Internet, pick up a quick packaged dinner and actually sit down and eat. They sell everything from underwear to Christmas ornaments (in June!) to asparagus juice.\"\n\nTo say nothing of the blood sausage, chicken-flavored Cheetos and tuna sandwich in a can. \nThese might be everyday indulgences for people in Taiwan and other countries in Asia, but for a food lover who hasn't ever seen these treats before, it's a culinary goldmine.\nSingapore\nPetition to make mashed potato vending machines a requirement for every store in the world.\n\nImage: FacebookWhen you're missing the Grandma's cooking, head to the Maggi mashed potato vending machine for a hearty helping of mashed potatoes and gravy. As the video shows, though the potatoes look liquid when dispensed, they firm up quickly. You can't pass up the chance to try the best part of Thanksgiving from a vending machine. \n\nA taste of cheer with roasted chestnuts\n\nImage: Vicki Ho/MashableClassic winter chestnuts are ready to eat right along with your diet soda and chips. Mashable Singapore editor and self-proclaimed foodie Vicki Ho says they have a \"sweet and squishy texture,\" which might not be so foreign to those used to eating stateside 7-Eleven hot dogs. \nThailand\nBread is out, sticky rice patties are in.\n\nImage: 7-ElevenThese sandwiches made with Thai glutinous rice are essential to your Thai 7-Eleven experience. The rice grains stick to each other (but not your hands) in a dense, sticky patty that absorbs the sauce and juice from the filling. Choose from fillings like fried chicken, soy fried pork, shredded pork, spicy minced meat and more. \nSausage finally gets the idolatry it deserves.\n\nImage: 7-ElevenTarn Susumpow, Mashable production assistant who grew up in Thailand, says, \"When I was a kid coming home on the school bus, the bus would stop in front of 7-Eleven. All the kids could jump off and get Slurpees and sausages.\" \n7-Elevens's selection includes sausages stuffed with bacon, German varieties and footlong versions chopped and served with ketchup or chili sauce. Just don't expect a bun when you get your sausage kick  — here, it's enjoyed au naturel. \nThere was even a limited run web series called Sausage Mansion, which promoted 7-Eleven and its hot dog and sausage products. \"Thai 7-Eleven franchises are controlled by an agro-conglomerate called Charoen Pokphand, which also owns industrial pork farms and a cable TV provider,\" CNBC reported in 2012.  \nJapan\nOnigiri, where form meets function meets delicious\n\n\nA photo posted by Mee Piyanat (@amenochikara) on Oct 15, 2015 at 7:45pm PDT\n\nIn Japanese food culture there is often an emphasis on making food beautiful or \"kawaii\" (cute). It's hard to get cuter than onigiri, triangular rice and nori (toasted seaweed) packets that are compact, wholesome and most importantly tasty. These are available all over Japan's 7-Elevens and come with fillings like salmon, cod roe, soy sauce and umeboshi (salty and piquant pickled plums). The coolest part might be the packaging, which keeps the crispy seaweed separate from the moist rice until you are ready to eat. \nThe Kit Kat selection of your wildest dreams\n\n\nA photo posted by Cris Martin (@krix7) on Nov 22, 2015 at 12:57pm PST\n\nThe selection of Kit Kats (regular and special edition) you get at 7-Eleven is just astounding. Rum raisin, strawberry cheesecake, wasabi, sweet red bean paste, matcha, golden citrus blend and Annin dofu flavor are just a few of the flavored Kit-Kats available in many Asian countries. Forget breaking off a piece of a Kit Kat bar, you'll have to get an entirely new carryon bag to cart home your tasty souvenirs. \nSouth Korea\nCheap but elaborate traditional Korean meals\n\nImage: 7-ElevenAn extensive Korean feast awaits you in a compact, partitioned container in any South Korean 7-Eleven. Instead of a tired ham and cheese sandwich, treats like galbi, bulgogi, kimchi, marinated seafood and seaweed salad await. Don't forget that steamed rice and hot miso soup to round out your meal. \nWinnie the Pooh-approved honey flavored treats\n\nImage: 7-Eleven KoreaThe U.S. needs to embrace honey the way Korea has. Honey cream cheese lattes sound like a cheesecake milkshake waiting to happen, and honey potato sticks could be the best sweet-and-salty combination since maple syrup and bacon. \nHong Kong (Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China)\nReady-to-eat duck tongue\n\nImage: YouTubeDuck tongues are popular in dim sum, where the juicy little morsels are often deep fried with Chinese spices and served hot. This ready-to-eat version in Hong Kong's 7-Eleven is marinated in citrus peel, cooking wine, superior pickle sauce and a slew of other ingredients. They can be enjoyed as is — just be careful to pluck out the tiny bone in the center before you gobble it whole.\nChina\nA year's worth of incredibly flavored potato chips\n\nImage: Vicki Ho/MashableCucumber. Braised pork. Cheesy lobster. Pepsi and chicken wing. These are only a few of the potato chip flavors available in the snack aisle of any Shanghai 7-Eleven. Like the U.S., flavors in the store change constantly. It makes your local 7-Eleven's got Flamin' Hot Cheetos look really lame. For a chance of pace, too bad you can't drown your sorrows in a bag of crunchy hot and sour fish soup-flavored potato chips. \nThese 7-Elevens might seem too far to enjoy, but don't pass them over on your next trip.  The nearest 7-Eleven might be the delicious and authentic spot you crave.\n",

That, however, did not meet the court-ordered mandate that the State Department release 43,000 pages by the end of the year. The State Department said it will release more emails next week to account for the missed deadline.\n\"We have worked diligently to come as close to the goal as possible, but with the large number of documents involved and the holiday schedule we have not met the goal this month,\" the department said in a release.\nThe dump of emails came at 4 p.m. EST on New Year's Eve, a time when Americans are unlikely to be reading the news.\nSee also: Hillary Clinton affectionately refers to Mitt Romney as 'Mittens'\nClinton's campaign says it was not up to them when to release the emails, and sought to deflect \"snark\" on the timing the day before the emails were released. Instead, the court order requires the State Department to release emails every 30 days. \n\nTo preempt any snark abt tomorrow's penultimate email release on #NYE: the end-of-month timing is not set by the campaign or State Dept\n— Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) December 31, 2015\n\nMany reporters tweeted snarky responses at the inopportune timing, nonetheless.\n\nBatch ofEmails onNew Years EveGHAuld LangZyne I\n— Michael Roston (@michaelroston) December 31, 2015\n\nOverall, many of the emails were heavily redacted, and provided little news to pull out. \nBut the emails did reveal some insight about what life was like in Clinton's inner circle at the State Department. \nHere are three things to digest from Thursday's email dump:\nClinton was perplexed by the viral 'Texts from Hillary' meme\nThe image of Clinton using her blackberry on a plane while donning sunglasses has become an iconic photo, as well as a meme that launched the \"Texts from Hillary\" Tumblr account.\nBut when a State Department diplomat emailed to note the photo went viral, Clinton was perplexed.\n\"Why now?\" she responded. \"That was on way to Libya?\"\nClinton's former chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, assured her the photo was great.\n\"You look cute,\" Mills wrote. \n\nHillary was apparently on her way to Libya in that iconic Texts from Hillary image, per email release pic.twitter.com/8Jod0Mbzum\n— Emily Cahn (@CahnEmily) December 31, 2015\n\nRiding in cars with Clinton\nPhilippe Reines, one of Clinton's top advisers, was perturbed that none of his colleagues responded to what he thought was a hilarious flow-chart to determine who rode alongside Clinton on car rides. \n\"I did NOT/NOT receive sufficient appreciation for the below,\" Reines wrote in an email. \"Only Jake reacted. It took HOURS to get the formatting right. Literally hours to ensure it would work on every size font. Without positive reinforcement I'm not sure I can continue to really invest myself in these missives/diatribes.\"\n\nHillary aide \"spent hours\" putting together a flow chart to determine who could ride in a car with her https://t.co/yD5ksw4VsR\n— Will Rahn (@willrahn) December 31, 2015\n\nFormer Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is a fan\nBuried in Clinton's emails are notes from many notable names, including Kissinger — who served as secretary of state under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.\nAt the bottom of a lengthy letter, in which he requested documents from his time at the State Department be declassified, Kissinger hand-wrote a line of praise.\n“I greatly admire the skill and aplomb with which you conduct our foreign policy,\" Kissinger wrote in the Feb. 7, 2012, memo. \n\nFmr SoS Kissinger is Clinton a fan. “I greatly admire the skill & aplomb with which you conduct our foreign policy.\" pic.twitter.com/y9MQjvnDAb\n— Emily Cahn (@CahnEmily) December 31, 2015\n\n",

         "Battery cases — \"smart\" or not — are for suckers and only highlight a modern smartphone's inability to last through an entire day without needing to be recharged. \nUntil we get a real battery breakthrough, cramming a bigger battery into a phone is the next best thing. That's exactly what the Oukitel K10000 phone packs. Whereas most smartphone batteries store between 1,500-3,000 milliamp-hours (mAh), the K10000 has a 10,000 mAh battery — good for 10 to 15 days according to a report from The Techolic.\nSee also: The 6 best iPhone apps for travelers of all time\nThe K10000's big battery is also good for charging other devices. That's right, it works like a battery pack and can recharge an iPhone 6S Plus up to three times.\nOther than the unusually large battery, the K10000 is a pretty average smartphone running Android 5.1 Lollipop. It has a 5.5-inch screen with 720p resolution (1,280 x 720), a 1GHz quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD card). It also supports dual SIM cards.\nOn the back is an 8-megapixel camera with LED flash, and the front camera is 2 megapixels. Nothing special.\nImpressive as the K10000's battery life sounds, we have to sour things a bit. At best, a phone with a 3,000 mAh battery is good for around 1.5 days. Extrapolating on that data that we've seen time and again from our Android phone reviews over the years, the K10000 will probably only last up to about five days of \"normal\" smartphone use consisting of web browsing, texting, video playback and light gaming, which is still significantly longer than most phones.\nIt's more likely the 10-15 day battery life is referring to talk time, and who really talks anymore on their phones? Of course, it's possible the phone can last up to 15 days if you simply don't use it very often.\nThe K10000 is available for from Gearbeast for $239.99 and ships on Jan. 2.\n",

         "\n\n\n\nNissan is not afraid to give credit where credit is due.\nAs the Japanese automaker looks to stake out a bigger claim to the pickup truck market with its super-sized new Titan XD model, it's taking the unusual step of tipping a hat to its more established, dominant American rivals in its advertising.\nIn a dramatic new 90-second commercial spot called \"Shoulders of Giants\" that debuted during the National Football Championship on Monday night, Nissan seems to admit that its new truck would not be possible without the ground already broken by Detroit's Big Three. \nSee also: Microsoft employees serenade Apple employees for 'peace on earth'\n\"To those who go before us — Chevy, Ford, Dodge. Thank you,\" the narrator says over shots of one particularly innovative model from each brand. \"We see the way forward.\" \nThat homage follows an emotional montage of caring parents, heroic firefighters and an impassioned football coach motivating a player — all ostensibly meant as analogies of Nissan's relationship with its competitors.\nOf course, there's a competitive edge to the ad as well. You don't figuratively stand on the shoulders of giants — a reference of course to an iconic quote made famous by Isaac Newton — unless you intend to surpass what they've done, and Nissan seems to be positioning its new Titan XD as the next big breakthrough that will render the best models of each of the American manufacturers things of the past.\nBut Nissan insists that the shoutout was not a backhanded compliment — though it's up to the viewers to ultimately decide — and that it was legitimately attempting to pay respects to fellow auto brands. \nThe fact that Nissan is lining its trucks up against Detroit's is ambitious in its own right. The Big Three have long locked down the U.S. market for pickups and Nissan currently only sports a one-percent sliver of a share.  \n",

         "A survivor hidden in a tree says he watched Boko Haram extremists firebomb huts and heard the screams of children among people burned to death in the latest attack by Nigeria's homegrown Islamic extremists.\nScores of charred corpses and bodies with bullet wounds littered the streets from Saturday night's attack on Dalori village just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram and the biggest city in the northeast, according to survivors and soldiers.\nSee also: ISIS isn't the world’s deadliest terrorist group. Boko Haram is.\nThe shooting and burning continued for four hours, survivor Alamin Bakura said, weeping on a telephone call to The Associated Press. He said several of his family members were killed or wounded.\nThe violence continued as three female suicide bombers blew up among people who managed to flee to neighboring Gamori village, killing many people, according to a soldier at the scene who insisted on anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to journalists.\nIt was not known how many scores of people were killed because bodies still were being collected, including from the surrounding bushes where the insurgents hunted down fleeing villagers, according to Abba Shehu, a security guard helping collect corpses.\nBoko Haram has taken to attacking soft targets, increasingly with suicide bombers, since the military last year drove them out of towns and villages in northeastern Nigeria.\nThe 6-year Islamic uprising has killed

But viewers had no idea what was coming, until he sent out a simple email on Saturday morning announcing the show's release.\n\"Hi there. Horace and Pete episode one is available for download. $5. Go here to watch it. We hope you like it. Regards, Louis,\" the comedian wrote.\nGod Louie, you're such a self-promoter. Calm down!\n\nImage: HoraceandpeteTitled Horace and Pete, the very dark comedy features comedic heavyweights Steve Buscemi, Aidy Bryant, Edie Falco and the artist himself. The series explores the lives of two slightly depressed Brooklyn bartenders running a — you guessed it — slightly depressed Brooklyn bar. \nThe first 67-minute episode feels contemporary and topical, with conversations ranging from Super Bowl quarterbacks to Donald Trump. \nWhile Horace and Pete is a dramedy, unlike Louie, the story is structured more like a dark drama than a comedy.\nThe first episode is currently available for purchase for $5 on Louis' site.\n",

And while many of these movies are geared towards children, Edward Scissorhands is about as far from Aladdin's Jasmine as you can get (though they BOTH have great hair).\nSee also: Why is the Internet obsessed with Disney princesses?\nRecently, however, the artist decided to fuse the two genres and give a bunch of Disney characters a gothic makeover. Sure, Tim Burton and Walt Disney have *slightly* different outlooks on life, but the artists share a visual vocabulary.

         "As the threat of the Zika virus looms worldwide, India's Tata Motors is getting ready to launch a hatchback named Tata Zica. The name, a combination of the words \"zippy\" and \"car\", had been chosen long before its namesake virus hit the headlines.\nSee also: Zika virus is spreading 'explosively' and may be international health emergency, WHO warns\nTata is India's fifth largest automaker, and the owner of the British luxury car brand Jaguar Land Rover. It is hoping to regain its market share in the country through the Zica, which will be launched during the forthcoming Indian Auto Expo this week. Designed by an international team, the small car has been received favourable reviews for its contemporary look and latest features. The company plans to follow its launch with a new line of passenger vehicles.\n\nWe have gone to great lengths to test the #Fantastico Zica. Imagine driving to the moon and back 5 times. pic.twitter.com/bCwaTABIZn\n— Zica Tata Motors (@ZicaTataMotors) January 3, 2016\n\nUnfortunately, its launch has coincided with the spread of the mosquito-born Zika virus, which results in birth defects such as microcephaly, or unusually small heads in babies. A few days ago, the World Health Organisation said that the virus was spreading \"explosively\" and may constitute a public health emergency.\nWhile the virus hasn't spread to India yet, doctors have predicted that the country may be at risk. On social media, several users have wondered whether the similar-sounding names will impact the sales of the car. A company spokesperson has said that while the car's name will not be changed for the launch, it may be renamed in the future.\n\nOh God! Tata is thinking of launching Zica in February, and we have a virus by that name.\n— Durlov Baruah (@lifeisbetter) January 29, 2016\n\n\nWhile the world is concerned about Zika virus, Tata is peddling Zica.

While the original mission was to make people look good, this time Guess wanted to focus on making people feel good as well.\n\"When designing this line, the idea was to keep it simple and create a collection of fashion-forward denim,\" a Guess representative  told Mashable. \"We had to ensure the styles weren’t too overdone since the fabric was to speak for itself.\"\nThe brand combined a clean silhouette with a subtle indigo hue to keep the collection refined.\n\"Everyone owns a piece of denim. You can buy that anywhere,\" Guess told Mashable. \"But when you add something different that no one else has, such as ... denim that helps improve your body — that is something not many people can say no to.  Denim is forever evolving, and Guess wants to continue to be a pioneer in that market.\"\nThrough the years Guess has often been ahead of the curve.

         "UPDATED: 3:00 p.m. GMT with Academy of Medical Sciences statement\nLONDON — Scientists in the UK have been granted permission to genetically modify human embryos in a bid to gain a deeper understanding of the earliest moments of human life.\nFollowing the green light from regulators Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), experiments could begin in the next few months, according to the BBC. However, scientists will not be allowed to implant the embryos into a woman.\nThe research — which will be undertaken at the Francis Crick Institute in London on embryos in the first seven days after fertilisation — could uncover currently unknown contributors to miscarriages. \nIn the UK, it's estimated that a miscarriage occurs in 15-20% of pregnancies, with 85% of miscarriages occurring in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\"The reason why it is so important is because miscarriages and infertility are extremely common, but they're not very well understood,\" Dr Kathy Niakan of the Francis Crick Institute said earlier this year. \nSee also: Finding hope when a pregnancy suddenly ends\nIn an emailed statement, the HFEA said it has attached a condition to the licence that any research using gene editing needs to first be approved by the Research Ethics Committee.\n\"Dr Niakan's proposed research is important for understanding how a healthy human embryo develops and will enhance our understanding of IVF success rates, by looking at the very earliest stage of human development,\" Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute, said after the decision.\nProf. Sir Robert Lechler, President of the Academy of Medical Sciences, said in a statement:\nIt is reassuring to see the HFEA approving Dr Niakan’s proposal. Studies such as this, that focus on asking basic questions about human-embryo development, are needed to help answer the many scientific and ethical questions remaining in this field. Genetic editing may in the future be applied clinically, to treat or prevent otherwise untreatable and serious genetic diseases. It is important that an open debate continues between not just researchers, but ethicists, healthcare professionals, regulators, relevant patients and their families, and the wider public. Dr Niakan's study will not just help to advance the biomedical sciences, but will further inform this ongoing debate, while keeping the UK at the forefront in the field.\nLast year, Chinese researchers made the first attempt at modifying genes in human embryos. Their laboratory experiment didn't work but raised the prospect of altering genes to repair the genes of future generations.\nScientists say such techniques could lead to treatments for inherited conditions.\nAround the world, laws and guidelines vary widely about what kind of research on embryos that will change the genes of future generations, is allowed. In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health won't fund this kind of research but private funding is allowed.\nCritics warn that tweaking the genetic code this way could eventually lead to a slippery slope.\n\"This is the first step on a path that scientists have carefully mapped out towards the legalisation of (genetically modified) babies,\" said David King, of anti-gene manipulation group Human Genetics Alert, last month when the British fertility regulator held its meeting to decide on granting the gene editing license.\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting.\n",

         "WEST DES MOINES, Iowa — Donald Trump's whole campaign has been based on winning. But after a major setback in Iowa, he's now going to have to cope with being seen as a loser — at least for now.\nTrump's disappointing second-place finish in the key early-voting state on Monday night, barely ahead of Marco Rubio, comes after recent polls showed him ahead of Ted Cruz. He's now facing huge pressure to hold onto his lead in New Hampshire, where recent polls have him with three times the support of any of his competitors.\nSee also: Donald Trump, you're the loser: Cruz wins Iowa\nTrump was remarkably gracious and restrained — and unusually brief — as he sought to portray the setback as a victory after he barely finished ahead of Marco Rubio in the state.\n\"I was told ‘do not go to Iowa, you can’t  even finish in the top 10,'\" he said in a speech that barely reached three minutes, spinning the results hard. \"We finished second and I have to tell you something, I’m honored, just honored, and I want to congratulate Ted. ... We’re just so happy with the way everything worked out.\"\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump blows a kiss to the crowd after conceding defeat in the Iowa Caucus during his President Caucus Watch Party at the Sheraton Hotel on February 1, 2016 in Des Moines, Iowa. Image: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThat's a far cry from Trump's declaration earlier this week that if he didn't win Iowa's caucuses all the time he spent in the state would have been a \"big fat beautiful... waste of time.\"\nEven after recent polls proved wrong and let him down, Trump expressed faith in surveys, pointing to a recent poll that had him up by 28 points in New Hampshire. But those numbers are certain to move after Cruz's win and Rubio's strong third-place showing.\n\n“No one remembers who came in second.” -  Walter Hagen\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2013\n\nThe brash billionaire has been the bully of the race, smacking down all comers who attacked him as he remained king of the GOP hill. And while Cruz was always a better natural fit for Iowa, Trump has leaned so hard into portraying himself as unbeatable that he'll need to restore that aura almost immediately.\nTrump will need to right his ship soon with a win in New Hampshire or soon thereafter — or his core argument that he should win because he's a winner will smash against the rocks and sink like a stone as more traditionally conservative candidates float past him.\n",

         "Jaguar Land Rover announced Monday morning that it is putting five highly automated vehicles on U.K. roads this year to test both connectivity and self-driving tech.\nImagine, for example, if your car knew about a patch of black ice before it crossed it and warned you so you could avoid.\n\nImage: Jaguar Land RoverSee also: End of an era: Land Rover Defender production stops today\nThis project is part of a much bigger vision than just black ice warnings, however.\nThe JLR vehicles are joining the £5.5-million ($7.9 million) U.K. Connected Intelligent Transport Environment (UK-CITE) project that includes 100 vehicles and a 41-mile test corridor between Coventry and Solihull, England. The project will utilize newly installed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems on public roads that will send information about traffic jams and road conditions before they can be seen.\nBefore self-driving cars can dominate the roadways, they'll need a tech infrastructure to support them. After all, exterior-mounted vehicle sensors can only see so far. During inclement weather, they can't see much at all, in fact. In order to reduce congestion and operate most efficiently, autonomous cars will need V2V and V2I communication to know what's coming.\nThis will allow autonomous cars to do something called \"platooning\" in which cars gather together in a tailgating formation. Not only would this make the fleet more efficient and also reduce the amount of space each car requires on the road. Of course, however, this sort of maneuver would require nonstop communication in order to be safe.\nEssentially, freeways of the future will be full of connected-car chatter, which will allow you to sit back, relax and watch Game of Thrones during your daily commute.

         "Who knew flat-screen TVs could be made so dramatic?\nLiam Neeson meets with a younger version of himself — played by the actor's real-life son Micheál Neeson — to discuss the time-traveling transport of LG's OLED television from the future in the electronics company's first-ever Super Bowl ad. \nSee also: Super Bowl advertisers just want America to have fun this year\nThe plot, if there is one, is not easily untangled. But the threat of some unnamed nefarious force that apparently wants to halt the TV's release makes the 60-second spot, which was produced by Ridley Scott, feel more like a trailer for a sci-fi thriller than a prosaic consumer electronics commercial. It ends with the younger Neeson inexplicably riding off on a motorcycle into a Tron-like maze.\n\"The future is staring back at us like a perfect picture on glass. And this future — it must be protected,\" Neeson tells his son in the commercial.\n\nThe Neesons aren't the only father-son duo that had a hand in the commercial — the spot was also directed by Scott's son Jake Scott. The elder Scott's involvement as a producer marks his first time working on a Super Bowl ad since he directed Apple's iconic \"1984\" commercial.\n",

         "Your coworker received a phone call, her voice dropped from pleasant to distraught in seconds; there was a death in the family. She’s now back at the office after time off, typing at her keyboard. Do you leap to her side and cradle her in your bosom? \nSummarize those moving posts by author and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who wrote, \"I want to choose life\" after her husband died? Keep it professional with a quick condolence on the way to the printer? Or play dumb and act as if nothing happened?\nGrief at the workplace can be uncomfortable. Conversations with coworkers tend to revolve around work and deadlines with a sprinkling of bon mots and light musings; suddenly it’s time to acknowledge a colleague’s deeply personal grief. \nIt’s challenging to know where the professional persona ends and the humanity begins when a coworker has lost a loved one.\nHere's the first thing to know: there is no one way to grieve, and no best way to talk about it. It depends on empathy and respect for another person's emotional state, going far deeper than the usual work conversation. \nSilicon Valley based executive coach Anna Ranieri, who holds advanced degrees in both business and psychology, suggests to start with the basics: “I’m sorry to hear about your loss.” Preferably face-to-face. There’s no need to exhibit Shakespearean poetic eloquence: simple empathy suffices, letting the bereaved know coworkers are willing to chat, listen, or help. \n\"Take the time to listen,” says Ranieri, “you can follow up in a way that is helpful.”\nOne can assume a brusque “I’m fine, no big deal,” generally indicates that the bereaved would rather not delve into the death at work, which Ranieri stresses to respect, rather than railroading a taciturn colleague into “coffee klatch mode,” as she puts it.  \n\nImage: Image: Luiz Alberto/Keystone/Getty ImagesA more animated response to a simple “I heard about what happened, I’m sorry,” might signal that talking further would be a comfort. “If you want to talk, should we chat now or meet for coffee later?” Ranieri suggests as a response.\n“The mistake most people make is ignoring it as if it didn’t occur,” says Joyce E. A. Russell, the Senior Associate Dean at the Robert H. School of Business in Maryland, of a colleague’s death in the family. “We are afraid we are going to say the wrong thing or set them off into this tailspin of crying,” says Russell, also an industrial and organizational psychologist. \nRussell believes avoiding a bereaved colleague is hurtful and ultimately confusing.  Most employees haven’t studied their employer’s bereavement policies and many don’t know a policy exists. \nIn the USA, a private employer is not obligated by federal law to give paid leave to employees for a relative’s funeral arrangements or attendance, though most do. \nUnion contracts usually have a bereavement leave in the agreement. Three to five paid days is considered standard for bereavement leave, also called funeral leave.\n“It would be very unlikely that someone would stand on their legal rights and say, ‘You can’t leave,’” says Samuel Estreicher, the Director of the Center for Labor and Employment Law at NYU Law, where he also teaches. “In fact, in my experience,” says Estreicher, “many employers shut down the shop and they all go to the memorial service, so it really depends.” \nPolicies are often outlined on the employer or union’s website, intranet or handbook. A good example is the insurance and finance company The Hartford [http://www.thehartford.com/newhire/hr-policy-process/bereavement-policy/], which clearly states the number of days allotted, what type of employee is eligible, and who is considered an “immediate family member.” \nIf an employee needs additional days off, vacation or personal days can be used or request unpaid leave. Bereavement leave is not covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act.\nManagers are usually the first to be alerted of an employee’s death in the family. Ranieri notes it’s important for a managers to ask directly, “What would you like me to say to your coworkers?“ so the manager doesn’t feel they are betraying a confidence when coworkers start to inquire about their colleague’s absence. \nManagers take responsibility for workload redistribution and might organize flowers or a donation in honor of the coworker’s deceased relative. \nWhen an employee has returned to the office, he or she might be teary, less productive or have difficulty concentrating, resulting in heavier workloads for others. That may go on for a while, since grief is diffuse and hard to predict. \n“That is the time to be empathic,” says Ranieri. The manager can suggest a few more days off if policy allows. However, many employees want to resume work, even if they are not fully productive. \nA colleague who has experienced a death in the family should be cut some slack, says Ranieri, adding, “It’s an opportunity that we don’t always have to show our care for each other.”\n\nFacebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote about how to approach someone who is grieving when her husband passed suddenly last year. Image: Eric Risberg/Associated PressDespite the variety of workplace cultures and personality types, a set of general workplace guidelines can be followed at the workplace:\nDo acknowledge a colleague’s loss.\nIf a face-to-face interaction is beyond the capabilities of the painfully shy, a simple card left on a coworker’s desk or mailbox is fine. If the grieving person is several generations older and much higher in rank, Ranieri says a card could be preferable; address it to Mr. or Ms.  \nDon’t judge and think a colleague should grieve like you did\nDon’t verbalize, hint, or suggest with body language like eye rolling that a colleague should have kicked their mourning to the curb months ago. Or the opposite: “Oh my gosh, I can’t believe you’re already back at work and you just lost your mom,” Russell gives as an example, adding, “That is insensitive.” \nDo remember grief isn’t always processed in a linear fashion.\n“Like getting better day by day by day,” explains Ranieri. Grief has no timeline. It may recede for minutes or hours and then come back for days. Understand that it is always there in some form. \nDon’t assume that you know how a coworker is feeling.\nGrief is complicated. When an elderly parent dies who had been living with dementia for years, or in pain, some feel a sense of relief when the family member passes, because they are finally at rest from their pain and confusion. Refrain from saying, “Oh, you must feel terrible.”\nDon’t post anything about your colleague’s situation on social media.\nAlso don't spread it around the workplace unless he or she has requested. An influx of comments may be more than they can handle. \nDo remember that the death of a pet can be devastating.\nThe death of a four-legged family member can be crushing. “Pets can be very important to people’s lives,” says Russell. It’s not ridiculous to express condolences to a coworker who lost a pet.\nDon’t give unsolicited advice.\nInstead, offer help and support. If you’ve experienced a similar situation, refrain from telling your coworker the details, implying they should follow suit. Instead, Ranieri suggests, “It took a while for me to get over this, if it’s like that for you and I can be helpful, please let me know.” If a colleague asks for advice outside of your scope of knowledge, don’t be a hero and give a mash-up of what you overheard on a Dr. Phil Show and that self-help book jacket you read; instead, tell them you’ll find helpful resources.\n\n\n\nTopics:\nBusiness, Jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  if(window.pageChanged)\n    window.omni({\"channel\":\"business\",\"content_type\":\"article\",\"v_buy\":null,\"v_buy_i\":null,\"h_pub\":1467.5,\"h_buy\":null,\"h_pub_buy\":null,\"v_cur\":1.9,\"v_max\":1.9,\"v_cur_i\":1,\"v_max_i\":1,\"events\":\"event51,event61\",\"top_channel\":\"business\",\"content_source_type\":\"Internal\",\"content_source_name\":\"Internal\",\"author_name\":\"Nina Roberts\",\"age\":\"61\",\"pub_day\":2,\"pub_month\":2,\"pub_year\":2016,\"pub_date\":\"02/02/2016\",\"sourced_from\":\"Internal\",\"isPostView\":true,\"post_lead_type\":\"Default\",\"topics\":\"Business,Jobs,Uncategorized\",\"campaign\":null,\"display_mode\":null,\"viral_video_type\":null,\"b_flag\":true});\n    metaData = {\"link\":[[\"canonical\",\"http://mashable.com/2016/02/02/how-to-grieve-at-work/\"],[\"image_src\",\"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzAyLzAzLzY2L0hlaWRpR3JpZWZhLmM5NDllLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4NjI3IwplCWpwZw/ea512f1a/168/Heidi-Grief-at-Work-1.jpg\"]],\"meta_property\":[[\"og:url\",\"http://mashable.com/2016/02/02/how-to-grieve-at-work/\"],[\"og:title\",\"How to grieve at work\"],[\"og:type\",\"article\"],[\"og:site_name\",\"Mashable\"],[\"og:description\",\"It's hard to know what to say, both for those who are grieving and their colleagues.

But what about malware that’s hidden outside of your hard drive, in the very code that tells your computer how to boot?\nSee also: The History of Computer Viruses [INFOGRAPHIC]\nVirusTotal, a malware-hunting subsidiary of Google, announced in a blog post it has a new tool that scans your computer's BIOS and UEFI firmware for malicious content. Your BIOS or UEFI are the links between your hardware and your software, and that firmware tells your computer how to boot. If there is malware present in that area of your computer, even replacing your hard drive won’t remove it — it exists in a chip on your motherboard.\nThis malware can repeatedly install software onto your computer before the operating system loads.\nAccording to the blog post, the effort to focus on scanning firmware is in response to recent reports of certain kinds of malware targeting the BIOS and UEFI of certain machines — specifically incidents regarding Lenovo and Hacking Team.\nIf VirusTotal’s new tool works, PC owners should have a little less to worry about, though you need a web connection to use it. The tool allows researchers to upload firmware images, which the tool examines by extracting executable code where malware might be present. The process then tells users whether there is malware present or not.\n",

         "DES MOINES, IOWA — Bernie Sanders — and his supporters — aren't letting Iowa go without a fight.\nAfter a result deemed by state officials to be the closest in Iowa caucus history, Sanders said \"as much information as possible should be made available\" about his narrow loss to Hillary Clinton. \nSee also: Hillary Clinton barely won, but Bernie Sanders is the true champion\nSpeaking to reporters on a flight from Des Moines to New Hampshire on Tuesday, the senator called on Iowa state Democrat officials revisit the vote counts — precinct by precinct, according to a report from The Guardian. \n“I honestly don’t know what happened. I know there are some precincts that have still not reported. I can only hope and expect that the count will be honest,” he said.\nBut Sanders wasn't the only one questioning the outcome in the state. Supporters were pitching their own conspiracy theories on unreported precincts as well as the controversial coin toss that decided how some delegates were awarded.\nThe top three topics on Reddit's popular conspiracy channel were all Sanders related on Tuesday morning. \nOne claimed a Clinton supporter and precinct chair lied about the vote counting in Des Moines Precinct 43, speculated about how Clinton won six coin tosses to break ties in certain areas, and another thread claiming the state's Democratic Party was missing votes from dozens of precincts — a fact the party itself denied, saying all the votes were counted.\nOn Twitter, people pointed to the Microsoft software being used by precincts to tally the votes as a potential source of misreported votes, especially after the platform suffered an outage during the caucus.\nThe Sanders campaign had previously questioned using the platform, with aides noting that Microsoft executives had donated hundreds of thousand of dollars to Clinton throughout her career.\n\nDidn't think I'd say this, I like the way Bernie Sanders is not conceding & he is the only candidate who spoke against microsoft app. #Trump\n— #MatthewSix33 (@SanctuaryForUs) February 2, 2016\n\nClinton narrowly edged out Sanders for a win in Iowa, though Democrats had outstanding results in one precinct — Des Moines precinct 42, until late Tuesday morning. \n\nDes Moines 42 is the last precinct left to report. Bill Clinton was president #42. Hmmm. #IowaCaucus\n— Bernito Sanderos (@BernitoSanderos) February 2, 2016\n\nSanders eventually won that precinct though that had no effect on the overall outcome in the state.\nIn other precincts, the results were so close that delegates for either candidate were being determined by a traditional coin toss.\n\nProof of a coin toss at Des Moines East High School. Landed heads and Hillary won the extra delegate. #IowaCaucus pic.twitter.com/Asrt4s8qJ7\n— Sage Rosenfels (@SageRosenfels18) February 2, 2016\n\nSome Bernie supporters, like this Iowa grassroots organizing group, were quick to point out the archaic nature of the coin toss.\n\"From experience, some of the rules with the Iowa Democratic party, some of the rules are a little outdated because they don’t get used very often,\" said Quinn Symonds, who is part of the Iowa for Bernie grassroots group and a delegate in the state.\n\nHey, coin flips are serious business in Iowa. We save them for serious stuff like for when who gets the family dog after a divorce.\n— Iowa for Bernie (@Iowa4Bernie) February 2, 2016\n\nSanders' result in the state has galvanized his campaign as he heads into the New Hampshire primary next week.\n“Tonight is a wonderful start to the national campaign,” Sanders said on Monday.  “Tonight shows the American people that this is a campaign that can win.”\nAmid all the confusion and conspiracies on Tuesday, one thing was clear: the Democratic primary fight isn't over. \n\"What we saw last night with the democrats, this is what we want,\" said Symonds. \"This is going to change the political climate in the United States and open the door of more progressive candidates to step into the arena.\"\n",

Local reports also suggested that at least one man was blown out of the plane.\nMohamed Hassan, a police officer in nearby Balad town, said residents had found the dead body of an old man who might have fallen from a plane.

It showed oxygen masks hanging overhead while wind rushes through the hole and into the plane's cabin. Passengers, some with their phones out, sit calmly.\n\n\"We just heard a loud noise and couldn't see anything but smoke for a few seconds, when visibility returned we realized quite a chunk of the plane missing,\" Kullane wrote of the incident.\nAnother of the plane's passengers Mohamed Ali told the Associated Press that they heard a bang before flames opened a gaping hole in the plane's side.\n\"I don't know if it was a bomb or an electric shock, but we heard a bang inside the plane,\" he said, adding he could not confirm reports that passengers had fallen from the plane.\n\"I think it was a bomb,\" said the Serbian pilot, Vladimir Vodopivec, who was quoted by Belgrade daily Blic. \"Luckily, the flight controls were not damaged so I could return and land at the airport. Something like this has never happened in my flight career. We lost pressure in the cabin. Thank god it ended well,\" the 64-year-old pilot said.\nSomali officials said the incident is under investigation and it wasn't yet clear what caused the blast. Initial reasons given ranged from fuselage failure to an oxygen tank that blew up. Foul play, while not initially suspected, may be to blame.\nOne source told CNN that initial tests of the damaged aircraft \"came back positive for explosive residue.\"\nSome information provided by the Associated Press.

         "A blowout at a natural gas well that gushed uncontrollably for 16 weeks and drove thousands of residents from their Los Angeles homes was plugged Thursday, a utility said.\nWhile the well still needs to be permanently sealed with cement and inspected by state regulators, the announcement by Southern California Gas Co. marked the first time the leak has been under control since it was reported Oct. 23.\nSee also: California gas leak is emitting 4.5 million cars' worth of pollution every day\n\"We have temporarily controlled the natural gas flow from the leaking well and begun the process of sealing the well and permanently stopping the leak,\" Jimmie Cho, a SoCalGas senior vice president, said in a statement.\nThe company also says it expects the incident will cost at least $250 million to $300 million and that the cost estimates don't include potential damages from more than two dozen lawsuits, penalties from government agencies and expenses to mitigate pollution.\n\nIf the plug holds and all goes according to plan to seal the well, the upscale Porter Ranch neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley could begin to return to normalcy after schools were closed and about 6,000 families were uprooted as they complained of headaches, nausea, nosebleeds and other symptoms as an intermittent stench wafted through the area.\nPublic health officials blamed their woes on an odorant added to gas so it can be detected and have said they don't expect longterm health impacts.\nThe leak at the largest underground gas storage reservoir in the West was declared an emergency by California's governor. At its peak, the leak was estimated to contribute about a quarter of the state's climate-altering methane emissions, leading some to call it the worst environmental disaster since the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\nWhile the gas was invisible, its impact could be seen in half-vacant subdivisions, two shuttered schools and on the faces of angry residents who packed public meetings and community forums and demanded the Aliso Canyon storage facility be shut down.\n\nTera Lecuona, resident of the heavily-impacted Porter Ranch area of Los Angeles, holds a protest sign during a hearing in Granada Hills over a gas leak at Southern California Gas Company's Aliso Canyon Storage Facility.Image: Richard Vogel/Associated PressThe blowout happened in a 60-year-old well that was built to pump oil from porous rock a mile-and-a-half below the Santa Susana Mountains. After the oil ran dry in the 1970s, the field of 115 wells was reused to store natural gas.\nWhen demand and prices were low, gas was injected at high pressure in the ground. It was piped out during cold months or to fuel gas-run electricity plants during energy spikes.\nRegulators will use high-tech equipment to survey the ruptured pipe for clues about what went wrong before cement is poured into the well to permanently cap it.\nResidents who voluntarily moved out will have at least a week to return to their homes after inspectors certify it is safe.\nSoCalGas has paid to relocate residents in hotels, apartments and houses. Hotel dwellers will have eight days to return home and those who moved to other accommodations can stay through the end of short-term leases they signed.\nIn recent weeks, many people have gone home as the rate of the leak dwindled and air filters were installed in their homes.\nOnce the well is sealed, though, life for some may never return to normal. The incident has focused attention on the aging facility and the state is investigating the impact if it were shut down to figure out how Southern California would replace a major source of energy.\nSome folks have said they don't want to move back, and many are concerned about what the incident has done to the value of their homes. The company is facing more than two dozen lawsuits, some of which seek class-action status.\n",

         "This is a story about how black superheroes can save your life. \nIn 1987 at the age of 7, my twin brother, John, was accused of shoplifting from a big box store in Greensboro, N.C., by an older white lady. Even as numerous employees confirming that he had not stolen anything, my mother and I watched as John was patted down in a full body search in the front of the store. After he was proven innocent, his accuser insisted: “Boys like him always steal.”  \nThat night, my father gave John and I “the talk” — the one explaining the difficulties we will face due to the color of our skin. The talk was far from uplifting. \nBeing black sounded like it was going to suck; the whole incident did a number on my self-image.  \nSee also: The power of diversity: 10 classic superheroes reimagined for today\nJohn and our older sister Candace seemed to do a better job at adjusting. John was a star athlete, giving him an outlet to build his confidence and develop social skills. Candace had a personality to which people were naturally drawn. But I was the smallest, the most reserved, and when I met new people I was always afraid they had motive to physically or mentally abuse me.  \nI developed obsessive-compulsive quirks, such as chewing my food (and my fingers) in seven bites at a time, and walking everywhere seven steps at a time. I would spend hours hiding in my room. I became an average student because I didn’t see the point in improving my mind. I would have fallen in with the wrong crowd, were I not afraid to interact with anyone outside of my family. \nLessons about black heroes in our school were not extensive, to say the least. There was one chapter on slavery in our history books, and one brief lesson on the Civil Rights movement. Mom and dad involved us in the NAACP and frequently talked about black history at home. But my underdeveloped perspective and mangled self-esteem only reinforced my idea that I was doomed to be nothing more but a victim of systemic racism.\nBut my parents were tenacious. In the summer of 1993, my father noticed my budding comic book collection and saw an opportunity. He took me to a comic book shop and asked an employee to bring out anything with black heroes.  \nThe dealer pulled out a stack of Milestone Comics: Icon #1, Hardware #1, Blood Syndicate #1, and Static #1. \nI felt the impact of seeing so many black and latino superheroes immediately. Even before reading a single word, I was drawn to these characters more than any I had previously known.  \nMilestone comics were unlike anything I had ever seen from a visual perspective, too. The illustrations were inventive and each character’s series offered their own aesthetic. I was moved by everything from the use of color to the texture of the pen strokes. You feel a certain type of energy in an artist’s work when they have the creative license to express themselves freely. A piece of their soul jumps out at you. When done properly, comic art can say more than any words can express. \nMilestone was a subsidiary of DC Comics, founded in June 1993. Usually having such a huge brand behind you means a strong executive hand seizes all of the power. In the case of Milestone, however, the founders, Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, Michael Davis, and Derek Dingle maintained full creative control over their creations. \nAt a time when people of color had less influence in the media than they do now, it was liberating to learn it was possible for me to create something innovative and maintain my integrity.\nMilestone comics made me suddenly aware that other comic books could be formulaic. Those tormented hero backstories that I once thought were interesting in other titles suddenly seemed predictable by comparison. The usual good-guy-versus-bad-guy battles became tired. I could see the epic crossover issue coming a mile away. Such tropes made for a decent read, but it didn’t connect on the same level as Milestone’s characters.  \nHere were superheroes dealing with real life issues such as drug abuse, homosexuality, disease, displacement, and bullying, just to name a few. They were fighting battles against evil, and against themselves, in ways that paralleled the world I was living in. And still they emerged as heroes.  \nThrough these stories I gained a new perspective of the world, which increased my tolerance and compassion towards others.\nThe Milestone character that had the greatest influence on shaping my identity is Virgil Hawkins, better known as Static. Standing in that shop, I could hardly take my eyes off of the cover of Static #1. \nThe simple image of a black teenager wearing a Malcolm X hat and shooting a bolt of lightning from one hand to the other is striking enough, but there was something else compelling about this him that I could not put my finger on. \nIt was not until days later that it hit me: This guy looked like me. He was a scrawny, dark-skinned, unassuming, geeky kid who didn’t fit in, couldn’t get the girl he wanted, and generally lacked self confidence. Reading Static was like looking into a mirror and staring back at me was a boy with great power and potential. \nFor the first time, I was a hero.\nOver the next couple of years I developed some confidence and developed as a painter, illustrator, and musician. The other kids at school started to recognize me as an artist, and that rocked my world. \nBefore Milestone, I saw myself as a kid doomed to society’s hatred. Now I was that kid who could do art. At last I believed something positive about myself. \nI have always felt there is a difference between knowing and believing. A child can come to know that it has potential through frequent, positive affirmation. But to believe in that potential — that has to be nurtured. My parents always told me that I could be great in spite of the racial struggles that lay ahead, but I didn’t actually believe it until I saw heroes that looked like me.\nIt’s been 23 years since I was introduced to the Milestone franchise, but it is still where I draw much of my inspiration. Today, I am a filmmaker, photographer, and musician trying to create something that inspires people the way I was inspired by Icon, The Blood Syndicate, Hardware, Static, and many more. \nThe imprint was killed off in 1997, though some of the characters carried over to other DC titles and cartoons. (Static is now a member of the Teen Titans.) Despite the popularity of comic characters such as Marvel's Black Panther — soon to be scripted by Ta-Nehisi Coates — there is no longer a whole comic book universe with predominantly minority characters.  \nI think about the child I was, and about the children who collect comics in 2016. In the era of issues like Islamophobia and police brutality, their self image may be more under assault than ever. What inspiration do they have?  \nThe more we can repeat the success of Milestone, the more everyone can see themselves as a hero.\n\n\n\nTopics:\nblack history, Black History Month, books, Comics, Entertainment, Superheroes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  if(window.pageChanged)\n    window.omni({\"channel\":\"entertainment\",\"content_type\":\"article\",\"v_buy\":null,\"v_buy_i\":null,\"h_pub\":1177.5,\"h_buy\":null,\"h_pub_buy\":null,\"v_cur\":1.1,\"v_max\":1.1,\"v_cur_i\":1,\"v_max_i\":1,\"events\":\"event51,event61\",\"top_channel\":\"entertainment\",\"content_source_type\":\"Internal\",\"content_source_name\":\"Internal\",\"author_name\":\"Quincy Ledbetter\",\"age\":\"49\",\"pub_day\":12,\"pub_month\":2,\"pub_year\":2016,\"pub_date\":\"02/12/2016\",\"sourced_from\":\"Internal\",\"isPostView\":true,\"post_lead_type\":\"Default\",\"topics\":\"black history,Black History Month,books,Comics,Entertainment,Superheroes,Uncategorized\",\"campaign\":null,\"display_mode\":null,\"viral_video_type\":null,\"b_flag\":true});\n    metaData = {\"link\":[[\"canonical\",\"http://mashable.com/2016/02/12/milestone-black-superhero/\"],[\"image_src\",\"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzAyLzEzLzM1L21pbGVzdG9uZXBvLjg0Y2UyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4NjI3IwplCWpwZw/8402771f/bb9/milestone-poster.jpg\"]],\"meta_property\":[[\"og:url\",\"http://mashable.com/2016/02/12/milestone-black-superhero/\"],[\"og:title\",\"Black superheroes saved a real life: Mine.\"],[\"og:type\",\"article\"],[\"og:site_name\",\"Mashable\"],[\"og:description\",\"Comic book heroics aren't just fantasy.
